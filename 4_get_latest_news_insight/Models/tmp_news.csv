Decide on Beant Singh killer Rajoana’s mercy plea by Republic Day, SC tells govt. "," The Supreme Court on Friday pushed the government to take a decision on a mercy petition filed by Balwant Singh Rajoana, facing capital punishment for the assassination of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh, before Republic Day. Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Rajoana, said it would be possible for the government to spare time for the mercy petition, which had been pending for the past eight years, as there is no foreign guest coming on January 26 for the Republic Day celebrations. Additional Solicitor General K.M. Nataraj informed the court that the mercy plea file was being processed and had been submitted before the competent authority within the government. The President would take the final decision on whether Rajoana should live or not. Mr. Rohatgi said the petition was filed in 2012. The death penalty of his client should be commuted on the sole ground of the delay on the part of the government to decide on the clemency petition. “The long passage of eight years without a decision from the government side is fatal to the death penalty. This court has said in several judgments that a delay of eight years is a ground for reduction of punishment from death to life imprisonment... Whatever they [the government] may do today on his mercy plea is thus infructuous,” Mr. Rohatgi argued. Chief Justice Bobde said the government was merely asking for another week or two before taking a call. “He has been in prison for 25 years,” Mr. Rohatgi reminded. “Another week or two will not change anything,” the Bench said. It was then that Mr. Rohatgi pressed for a decision on the mercy plea before January 26. The court agreed, even as the government said that the file would be processed at the earliest. “January 26 is a good day to call it,” Chief Justice Bobde remarked orally. On December 4, the Supreme Court was livid to find that the Centre had kept a condemned man’s plea for Presidential mercy hanging in limbo despite having decided over a year ago to spare his life. The decision was taken in commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in 2019. However, the government had failed to make good its declaration till date. Rajoana, in a petition to the Supreme Court from his jail cell, had said his repeated pleas to the government about the fate of his mercy plea was met with silence. He called the delay inexplicable.  Mr. Nataraj had explained that Rajoana’s plea was kept in abeyance because appeals filed by his fellow accused were pending in the Supreme Court. However, the court had said the law was already settled that once the government decided to recommend a Presidential pardon for a condemned man, the pendency of appeals in the Supreme Court of his co-accused could not delay the process initiated under Article 72 [Presidential pardon] of the Constitution. Moreover, the CJI had noted, Rajoana had no appeals pending in any court.",thehindu

Japan starts 1st day under emergency steps to curb virus
"," Japan began its first day under a coronavirus state of emergency on Friday with much of life as usual, including morning commuter trains shuttling crowds of mask-wearing people at bustling stations. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga reiterated his request for restaurants to shorten business hours and for people to work from home. “We take this very seriously. By all means, I would like to overcome this difficult situation with the cooperation of the people,” Mr. Suga told reporters. The emergency runs through February 7. The declaration is asking restaurants and bars close by 8 pm while drinks won't be served after 7 pm. It applies to Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa. Nationwide, confirmed COVID-19 cases have reached some 260,000, with more than 7,500 new cases reported Friday. “Infection is the highest ever in every region of the nation,” said Mr. Suga. Mr. Suga has promised legal revisions, including allowing penalties and other measures to add more force to the requests. They will be studied in parliament later this month. The declaration is expected to have some sway in conformist Japan. Some companies have been resistant to working remotely and the emergency state may help workers assert their wishes to stay home. But much of life will stay the same, with schools, sports events, stores and movie theaters open, but with social distancing and mask-wearing measures. Crowds are expected to thin at night. The previous emergency, declared last April and May, although wider in scope and area, had some effect on curtailing the spread of COVID-19. The number of daily cases in Tokyo have been climbing, reaching a daily record 2,447 Thursday. The goal is to bring them down to 500, according to officials. Like many other Tokyo residents, Kazue Kuramitsu was already pessimistic about how long it might take for things to get back to normal. “From today, we're basically in a battle for one month. But I don't think the spread will stop,” she said. ",thehindu

Apple's latest AirPods Max has a condensation problem
","(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.) Several Apple AirPods Max owners complained that their new and expensive headsets formed water droplets inside the ear cups. One user said the condensation issue started right after a 40-minute light walk at one point, and after watching an hour-long movie at another time. Donald Filimon, another user, had tweeted that the water even gets inside the drivers, causing ear detection problems. He clarified that the headset was used inside his room, and not in any humid environment. The AirPods Max was launched in December, and a pair costs Rs. 59,900 in India. Apple has not responded to The Hindu's query on the condensation issue at the time of publishing this story. Mohsen Abbasi, a product designer and a trusted Google Street View badge holder, explained in a tweet that the huge temperature difference between the ear and the cup may have caused the issue. ""The huge metal surface functions as a sink and your ears are source. There is nothing to do. This design requires heating element in the cups. Apple will put it on you for sure,"" Abbasi tweeted. AirPods Max is made of metal, which makes it more likely to get cooled and start picking up moisture from warmer air inside. Abbasi suggested that Apple would fix the issue in its next generation AirPods Max by ""heating the cups to match the ear temperature.""",thehindu

Supreme Court asks Centre to arm forest officers in fight against poachers
"," The Supreme Court on Friday urged the government to arm forest officers and provide them with bullet-proof vests and vehicles when told that India recorded the “greatest number of mortal fatalities” among forest officials in the world. Also read: When poachers have more guns than forest officials Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, senior advocate Shyam Divan said India accounted for 30% of fatalities among forest rangers in the world. Chief Justice Bobde said forest officials were up against a very powerful force.  “Proceeds of crime are in millions of dollars. This is an international crime. Recently, I was told that the pangolin skin trade extended to China because people believe they are good for certain things,” Chief Justice Bobde noted. The court said the Centre should consider involving premier organisations such as the CBI to help the forest staff. “There should even be a separate wing or wildlife division in the Enforcement Directorate with clean officials to track and investigate crimes of the poachers and the proceeds of their crimes... The amounts involved are huge and justify the formation of a separate wing by the ED,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre. Chief Justice Bobde pointed out how forest rangers in Assam were armed and “no one dares come near them”. “But in States like Madhya Pradesh, they roam around with lathis. In Karnataka, forest guards are in chappals and [carry] just lathis... In these States, forest guards are slapped around by poachers,” the CJI observed. He asked Maharashtra counsel Rahul Chitnis why forest officers in the State were not armed. Mr. Chitnis, however, insisted that they were. “But why this unequal situation among forest officials from State to State? Forest officers have larger responsibilities than police officers in cities. They patrol large tracts of uninhabited forests. A forest guard is alone in his duty, unlike a police officer in a city who can call for back-up,” Chief Justice Bobde said. Amicus curiae A.D.N. Rao said States did not utilise funds meant for arming the forest force. Mr. Divan said forest officers brave enough to take action were faced with a counterblast when they were made accused in various criminal cases by powerful forces operating behind the poachers. “Forest officers above a certain rank need arms for self-protection, bullet-proof vests, helmets and vehicles... the situation is serious. They are helpless and in danger, while poachers take undue advantage to carry out their nefarious activities. It is difficult to imagine how any law can be enforced by forest staff who are unarmed against heavily armed poachers,” Chief Justice Bobde said. The court asked the Solicitor General, Mr. Rao and Shyam Divan to make a joint submission on the measures that could be adopted to protect the forest staff so they could perform their duty without fear. The court posted the case after four weeks.",thehindu

U.S. Capitol violence | Simon & Schuster drops book by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley
","A planned book by Sen. Josh Hawley, who objected to President-elect Joe Biden’s win and backed baseless claims that the election was stolen, has been cancelled by its publisher in the wake of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by a mob of pro-Trump supporters, a decision the Missouri Republican called “Orwellian” and vowed to fight in court. (Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.) In a statement on Thursday, Simon & Schuster announced that “After witnessing the disturbing, deadly insurrection that took place on Wednesday in Washington, D.C, Simon & Schuster has decided to cancel publication of Senator Josh Hawley’s forthcoming book, The Tyranny of Big Tech.” “We did not come to this decision lightly,” the publisher added. “As a publisher it will always be our mission to amplify a variety of voices and viewpoints: at the same time we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom.” Thousands of Trump supporters had gathered in Washington on Wednesday to protest Congress’ formal certification of Mr. Biden’s win and many ended up storming into the Capitol and occupying it for hours, delaying the process into early Thursday morning. A widely seen photo, taken before the occupation, shows Mr. Hawley raising a fist in solidarity to the crowd.

Analysis | After Capitol siege, friends and foes slam Donald Trump’s poll fraud claims  Mr. Hawley has often been cited as possible future presidential candidate and his book, scheduled to come out in June, was an intended forum for a favourite theme — the undue power of Google, Facebook and other internet giants. Soon after news broke that his book was dropped, Mr. Hawley tweeted, and tagged his comments directly to Simon & Schuster, that he was being unfairly censored and punished: “I was representing my constituents, leading a debate on the Senate floor on voter integrity, which they have now decided to redefine as sedition.” “This could not be more Orwellian... Let me be clear, this is not just a contract dispute. It’s a direct assault on the First Amendment... I will fight this cancel culture with everything I have. We'll see you in court,” he wrote. Simon & Schuster quickly issued another statement: “We are confident that we are acting fully within our contractual rights” to cancel the book. Simon & Schuster has had numerous clashes with Mr. Trump and his supporters over the last few years. It called off a deal with the far-right writer and commentator Milo Yiannopoulos and published several anti-Trump best-sellers, including niece Mary Trump’s Too Much and Never Enough and former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s The Room Where It Happened. New York publishers had already expressed wariness about taking on a post-presidential memoir by Mr. Trump, whose Crippled America was published by a Simon & Schuster imprint in 2015, and this week’s events makes a deal with them far more unlikely. A Simon & Schuster spokesperson declined comment on whether the publisher would be interested in a new Trump book.

Bharat Biotech to begin Phase-1 trials of its intranasal vaccine for COVID-19 in Feb-March
"," Buoyed by the Emergency Use Authorisation approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin, Bharat Biotech has said Phase-1 clinical trials of its new intranasal antidote for the killer virus will begin during February-March this year. Besides Covaxin, Bharat Biotech has been actively working on developing another vaccine, for which it tied up with Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis for the novel “chimp-adenovirus” (Chimpanzee adenovirus), a single dose intranasal vaccine for COVID-19. “BBV154 (intranasal COVID-19 vaccine), preclinical testing has been completed for toxicology, immunogeni city and challenge studies. These studies have been conducted in the USA and India. Phase I human clinical trials will commence during Feb-March 2021,” an email reply from the city-based vaccine maker told PTI. Phase I human clinical trials will be conducted in India, Bharat Biotech added. The Phase-1 trials will be conducted in Saint Louis University’s Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit, the company sources said adding Bharat Biotech owns the rights to distribute the vaccine in all markets except USA, Japan and Europe. Krishna Ella, Chairman of Bharat Biotech had earlier said the company is focusing on the intranasal vaccine as the existing vaccines require two dose intramuscular injections and a country like India needs 2.6 billion syringes and needles which may add up to pollution. An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive, he had said. “One drop of vaccine in each of the nostrils is sufficient,” he had said. According to him, keeping several issues in mind Bharat Biotech tied up with Washington University School of Medicine for the single dose intranasal vaccine for COVID-19. He had said Bharat Biotech envisions that it would scale this vaccine to one billion doses, translating into equal number of individuals being vaccinated receiving a single-dose regimen. Bharat Biotech, upon obtaining required regulatory approval, will pursue further stages of clinical trials in India and undertake large scale manufacture of the vaccine at its GMP (good manufacturing practice) facility located in Genome Valley, here, the company had earlier said. The intranasal vaccine candidate has shown unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies and the technology and data having been already published in the prestigious scientific journal Cell and in an editorial in Nature, the company had said. Bharat Biotech has successfully completed enrollment of 25,800 volunteers for the Phase-3 trials of its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin.",thehindu

A difficult fiscal scenario faces the State: Governor’s address
"," Though Kerala is facing hardships in the economic front due to the severe adverse impact of the pandemic, the Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has said it is highly gratifying to tell the world at large that the Government has lived up to its promise that no one shall go hungry during the lockdown period. Addressing the 22nd session of the 14th Kerala Assembly on Friday, the Governor said this was made possible with the active participation of Local Self Governments and Community Volunteers. Community Kitchens were opened to provide food to the needy and it was ensured that Guest Workers got food of their choice. COVID-19 has considerably impeded the normal social life in the State. All countries in the world are facing the challenges posed by the pandemic in differing degrees. “Kerala has almost 9% of its population living abroad. The impact of the pandemic has been quite severe on the State economy. Kerala receives remittances from abroad to the tune of 12 per cent of its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). The coming back of around 6 lakh emigrants will hamper the flow of remittances and this will dampen the robust private consumption expenditure in the State”, he said. The Governor said a direct consequence of this is a downward slide in the economic growth of the State. Expert Committee has estimated the loss in GSDP for financial year 2020-21 at a phenomenal figure of ₹80,000 crore which is about 10% of the GSDP. The deep dent faced by the economy is bound to adversely affect the revenues at various levels. Kerala will face the double whammy of lower own tax revenue collections and reduction in devolution of Central taxes due to the economic down turn resulting from the pandemic. Along with reduced revenue inflows the expenditure burden has also gone up. The Governor said the Government has been taking proactive steps to mitigate the rigours of the COVID-19 pandemic and revive the various sectors of the economy. “ We are determined to revitalise our economy and make sure that adequate employment opportunities are generated for our people including persons who have been compelled to return from abroad leaving their jobs”, he said.",thehindu

Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine appears effective against mutation in new coronavirus variants: study
"," Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine appeared to work against a key mutation in the highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the U.S. drugmaker. The not-yet peer reviewed study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralising virus with the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein. The mutation could be responsible for greater transmissibility and there had been concern it could also make the virus escape antibody neutralisation elicited by the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists. The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine. Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus. Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against. “So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.” Dormitzer noted another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, is also concerning. The researchers plan to run similar tests to see if the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the U.K. andSouth African variants and hope to have more data within weeks. Scientists have expressed concern that vaccines being rolled out may not be able to protect against the new variants,particularly the one that emerged in South Africa. Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said this week that while both variants had some new features in common, the one found in South Africa “has a number additional mutations” that included more extensive alterations to the spike protein. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc., which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.",thehindu

The United States has indefinitely suspended 25% tariffs on French cosmetics, handbags and other imports it had planned in retaliation for a digital services tax Washington says will harm U.S. tech firms, as it investigates similar taxes elsewhere. The U.S. Trade Representative's office (USTR) said on Thursday that the 25% tariffs on imports of the French goods,which are valued at around $1.3 billion annually, would be suspended indefinitely. Washington announced the tariffs in July after concluding a French digital services tax would harm firms such as Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. The USTR said suspending the action against France, which had been due to come into force on Jan. 6, will allow it to pursue a coordinated response in 10 investigations involving other countries, including India, Italy, Britain and Turkey.

14,/india/all-india/080121/supreme-court-are-farmers-protected-from-covid-19.html,Supreme Court: Are farmers protected from Covid-19?,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed apprehensions that the gathering of thousands of protesting farmers at Delhi borders could lead to the ""same problem"" that arose due to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation here in March last and asked the Centre whether the protesters are ""protected"" against the spread of COVID-19. It also said the guidelines to contain the coronavirus should be followed. The apex court was hearing a plea seeking various reliefs including a CBI probe into the matter related to assembly of people at Anand Vihar Bus Terminal and the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizammudin Markaz amid the pandemic and lockdown. You must tell us what is happening. The same problem is going to arise in farmers' agitation. I do not know if farmers are protected from COVID. So, the same problem is going to arise. It is not that everything is over, said Chief Justice S A Bobde, who was heading the bench which also comprised Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. The top court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, whether the protesting farmers are protected from the spread of COVID. The COVID-19 guidelines include wearing of face masks at public places and social distancing norms. Mehta replied, Certainly not. Mehta said he will file a report within two weeks on what has been done and what needs to be done. The protests by the farmers at the border points in the national capital demanding the repeal of the three new farm laws began on November 28. The plea in the top court filed by advocate Supriya Pandita has alleged that the Delhi police had failed to control the gathering of people at Anand Vihar Bus Terminal last year during the lockdown. Advocate Om Prakash Parihar, appearing for the petitioner, Thursday told the bench that the police has not said anything about the whereabouts of Nizamuddin Markaz chief Maulana Saad. The bench told Parihar, Why are you interested in one person? We are on the issue of COVID. Why do you want controversy? We are interested that COVID guidelines should be followed. The apex court said it is trying to ensure that COVID-19 does not spread and the guidelines are followed. Issue notice. In the meantime, respondents shall file their reply affidavit, if any, the bench said in its order. During a media briefing on April 18 last year, the Union Health ministry had said that of the 14,378 coronavirus infections reported in the country till that date, 4,291 cases in 23 states and union territories are linked to the Markaz event held in Delhi's Nizamuddin area in March. The Centre had on June 5 last year told the top court that the probe into assembly of people at Anand Vihar Bus Terminal in east Delhi during nationwide lockdown and the Tablighi Jamaat event is being conducted on a day-to-day basis by Delhi Police and there was no need for CBI investigation. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had earlier given the details of steps taken by the Delhi Police which is making all efforts to complete the investigation within the time frame to submit the charge sheet in the trial court. It had told the top court that due to fake media reports and circulation of certain misinformation in the areas of Delhi, thousands of migrants gathered at Anand Vihar Bus terminal and Ghazipur border areas here on March 28 last. On the steps taken by the Delhi Police, the MHA in its affidavit had said that the probe in the Markaz matter is being conducted on a day-to-day basis, in accordance with the mandate of law and all efforts are being made to finalize investigation and submit a report under section 173 CrPC (charge sheet) before the trial court in a time bound manner. The MHA had alleged that Maulana Saad and others had allowed a huge gathering to assemble inside a closed premise, over a protracted period of time, without any semblance of social distances or provision of masks and sanitizers and have caused a situation where a highly infectious disease such as COVID-19 may spread and threaten the lives of inmates. It had said that a case was lodged against Maulana Saad under various provisions including The Epidemic Disease Act, Disaster Management Act and sections of the IPC with crime branch police station and during the investigation of the case, charges under the Foreigners Act was also added. The Ministry had pointed out that there was no negligence or delay in dealing with the Markaz incident and police had on March 21 contacted the authorities of Tablighi Jamaat Headquarters and apprised them of the COVID-19 situation and was directed to send the foreigners back to their respective countries and Indians to their native places.",theasianage
15,/world/americas/080121/us-to-modify-h1b-visa-selection-process-to-give-priority-to-wages-skill-level.html,"US to modify H1B visa selection process, to give priority to wages, skill level","Washington: The United States on Thursday announced that it will modify the selection process for H-1B visa, giving priority to salary and skills instead of the current lottery procedures. The final rule to be published in the federal register on January 8, officials said, is aimed to protect the economic interests of US workers and better ensure the most highly skilled foreign workers benefit from the temporary employment programme. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Modifying the H-1B cap selection process will incentivise employers to offer higher salaries, and/or petition for higher-skilled positions, and establish a more certain path for businesses to achieve personnel needs and remain globally competitive, said US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. The next H-1B visa filing season is slated to start on April 1. The H-1B temporary visa programme has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs, said USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow. The current H-1B random selection process makes it difficult for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the programme to compete for the best and brightest international workforce, and has predominantly resulted in the annual influx of foreign labor placed in low-wage positions at the expense of US workers, he said. This effort will only affect H-1B registrations (or petitions, if the registration process is suspended) submitted by prospective petitioners seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions. It will be implemented for both the H-1B regular cap and the H-1B advanced degree exemption, but it will not change the order of selection between the two as established by the H-1B registration final rule, USCIS said. The Department of Homeland Security had previously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on November 2, 2020. It carefully considered the public comments received before deciding to publish the proposed regulations as a final rule, USCIS said. According to the final rule, a version of which was released by Department of Homeland Security, Instead, a registration system that faithfully implements the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) while prioritising registrations based on wage level within each cap will incentivize H-1B employers to offer higher wages, or to petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher-skilled aliens that are commensurate with higher wage levels, to increase the likelihood of selection and eligibility to file an H-1B cap-subject petition. Moreover, it will maximize H-1B cap allocations, so that they more likely will go to the best and brightest workers; and it will disincentivise abuse of the H-1B programme to fill relatively lower-paid, lower-skilled positions, which is a significant problem under the present selection system, it said. While administering a random lottery system is reasonable, it is inconsiderate of Congress's statutory purposes for the H-1B program and its administration, said the final rule. The changes in this final rule will apply to all registrations, including those for the advanced degree exemption, submitted on or after the effective date of the final rule. As per Congressional-mandated cap, USCIS in one year can issue a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas. It can also issue another 20,000 H-1B visas to those foreign students who have completed higher studies from a US university in STEM subjects. During the public notice period, the department said, several commenters expressed support for the rule and the need to stop visa fraud, abuse, and flooding of petitions by certain staffing or consulting companies. One commenter said the proposed rule would disincentivize companies from abusing the H-1B programme and harming US workers. Other commenters said the proposed rule would decrease potential visa abuse by employers and make sure all workers were paid according to their skillset as employers no longer would be able to lower labor expenses by hiring foreign workers. Another said that the proposed rule would have a positive impact on US employees and college educated US citizens who take out loans for their education by making it harder for technology companies to discriminate against US citizens; US workers are being laid off in large numbers because corporations are outsourcing for profits; and the proposed rule is necessary because Indian corporations are acquiring US jobs, it said.",theasianage

DeVos, whose resignation comes into effect on Friday, said the insurrection on Capitol Hill was an ""inflection point"" for her, while Chao said she was deeply troubled by the violence. Chao's resignation will come into effect on Monday. In her resignation letter to President Trump on Thursday, DeVos said, We should be highlighting and celebrating your administration's many accomplishments on behalf of the American people. Instead we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the US Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people's business."" ""That behaviour was unconscionable for our country. There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,"" she said, adding that impressionable children are watching all this, and they are learning from us. Earlier in the day, Transport Secretary Chao also announced her resignation. In an email to her staffers on Thursday afternoon, Chao said, ""Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed. As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside."" DeVos and Chao join a growing exodus of officials in the final days of the Trump administration A day earlier a number of senior White House staffers resigned over the Capitol Hill violence. They include US Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger, first lady Melania Trump's chief of staff Stephanie Grisham, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews and White House social secretary Rickie Niceta. Mick Mulvaney, the US special envoy for Northern Ireland and the former acting White House chief of staff, also resigned. I can't stay here. Not after yesterday, he told the CBS news. Among others who submitted their resignations on Thursday were Tyler Goodspeed, the acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors; and John Costello, deputy assistant secretary for intelligence and security at the Commerce Department. ",theasianage
17,/india/all-india/080121/allow-panchayats-to-deal-with-problematic-wild-animals-national-board-of-wildlife.html,Allow panchayats to deal with problematic wild animals: National Board of Wildlife,"Hyderabad: If the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change has its way, the day may not be far when gram panchayats will be able to take decisions on how to deal with wild animals that may have become a threat to their lives or livelihoods. In a significant decision that may have far-reaching consequences with respect to protection of wildlife, and how authorities may have to deal with human-wildlife conflict situations, the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) has advised all states and union territories (UTs) to give gram panchayats powers to deal with situations relating to ‘problematic’ wild animals. The Standing Committee of the NBWL, that met in New Delhi this past Monday, approved an advisory that envisages empowering gram panchayats to deal with “problematic wild animals as per the section 11 (1) (b) of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.” This provision gives the power to deal with a wild animal to the Chief Wildlife Warden (CWW) or an authorised officer. As per the law, such an officer or the CWW may, if satisfied that any wild animal specified in Schedules II to IV of the Act has become dangerous to human life or to property, may issue orders for it to be hunted. However, incidents involving animals in Schedule I of the Act, such as the tiger or the leopard and other big carnivores, will not fall under the purview of the new advisory. For instance, the local gram panchayats in Kumaram Bheem-Asifabad district, that saw two cases of people being killed this past November, by a wandering tiger, will not be allowed to take decisions on how to deal with the situation. It would be dealt with according to provisions laid down by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). “This is in essence, kicking the responsibility of dealing with a conflict situation from one to another,” K. Ullas Karanth, respected wildlife biologist and leading tiger expert in the world, told Deccan Chronicle. The CWW has the power under the law to declare any action in a human-animal conflict situation. Somebody will have to accept the responsibility for an action and that will be an officer of the government. “An advisory is just that, an advisory. Changes in the process will require amendments to the law,” karanth said. According to Nawab Shafat Ali Khan, a well-known hunder of problem animals, “the desired result will not be achieved by such decisions unless there is a change in the mindset when it comes to dealing with human-animal conflicts.” Some states, such as Gujarat, already allow gram panchayats to take the decision on dealing with human-animal conflicts but any decision taken by the village governments have to be communicated to the forest officials and the action has to comply with all rules and laws dealing with a problem animal.",theasianage

Petrol price on Thursday was hiked by 23 paise per litre and diesel by 26 paise a litre, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies. In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 84.20 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 74.38. In Mumbai, petrol comes for Rs 90.83 a litre and diesel for Rs 81.07. This is the highest ever price of petrol in Delhi, while diesel is at record high in Mumbai. State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) had on Wednesday resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus. Price had been raised by 26 paise per litre for petrol and 25 paise on diesel on Wednesday. The previous highest ever rate of Rs 84 a litre for petrol in Delhi was touched on October 4, 2018. On that day, diesel too had scaled to an all-time high of Rs 75.45 a litre. The government had responded to that situation by cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later. However, no tax cut is under consideration as of present, a senior government official had said on Wednesday. Though petrol and diesel rates are to be revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange, government-controlled fuel retailers have been moderating rates since the pandemic broke out. They first did not pass on to the customers a reduction in price warranted from the slump in international oil rates witnessed due to demand erosion beginning March 2020. While they promptly passed on an increase in sales tax by state governments such as the one in Delhi, they adjusted a steep increase in excise duty by the central government against the reduction in retail price warranted. The government raised excise duty by Rs 13 per litre on petrol and by Rs 15 a litre on diesel in two instalments in March 2020 and May 2020 to garner additional revenue of Rs 1.6 lakh crore. That adjustment of rate revision against excise duty hike resulted in a 52-day status quo in prices between March 17, 2020, and June 6, 2020. This was followed by no change in rates between June 30, 2020, and August 15, 2020, and 58-day hiatus in petrol price revision and 48-day status quo on diesel rates from September 22, 2020, and October 2, 2020, respectively. Rates were again frozen after the last revision on December 7, 2020. Since May 2020, petrol price has risen by Rs 14.54 per litre and diesel by Rs 12.09 a litre, price notifications of oil companies showed. The highest level for petrol in Mumbai was on October 4, 2018 when it was Rs 91.34.",theasianage
19,/world/americas/080121/biden-wins-amid-chaos.html,Biden wins amid chaos...,"Washington: In an unprecedented assault on democracy in the US, thousands of supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building here and clashed with police, resulting in four deaths and interrupting a constitutional process by Congress to affirm the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in the election. The Electoral College votes of Biden and Harris were finally approved early on Thursday after both the Senate and the House of Representatives rejected all objections raised by the Republicans to the votes in the states of Pennsylvania and Arizona. In the presidential election held on November 3, Biden and Harris received 306 electoral votes, while President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence got 232. The counting of Vermont's three electoral votes put Biden and Harris over the 270-threshold needed to win the presidency. The 78-year-old Democratic leader and his 56-year-old Indian-origin deputy will be inaugurated on January 20, it was announced after the constitutional process was finally completed by a joint session of Congress. In the violence on Wednesday, four people died, including one woman who was shot by a police officer, amid protests and rioting on Capitol Hill that resulted in dozens of demonstrators being arrested, police said. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee called the rioting by pro-Trump demonstrators ""shameful"" during a news conference. One woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police during the rioting. Police said three other people - a woman and two men - died after apparently suffering ""separate medical emergencies"" near the Capitol grounds. At least 14 DC Metropolitan Police officers were injured, including one who was hospitalised after suffering serious injuries when he was pulled into a crowd and assaulted, Contee said. Metro Police made 80 arrests related to unrest this week in downtown DC, including 68 arrests on Wednesday night, according to a mayor's spokeswoman. Most were for violations of the mayor's 6 p.m. curfew. In a statement released just after the certification was finalised, Trump acknowledged his election loss. He said that even though he disagrees with the outcome, ""there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."" ""I have always said we would continue our ... fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!"" The joint session of Congress, which is normally a ceremonial step, was halted for several hours when supporters of Trump breached the Capitol. Proceedings resumed and continued through the night after the building was cleeared. Vice President Pence brought the Senate session back into order and proceeded with the verification process. ""The announcement of the state of the vote by the President of the Senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected President and Vice President of the United States, each for the term beginning on the 20th day of January 2021...,"" Pence said following the count of all of the state's Electoral College votes. Earlier on Wednesday, thousands of angry supporters of Trump swarmed over the US Capitol, forcing lawmakers to evacuate their chambers and delaying by several hours a normally routine procedure clearing the way for Biden and Harris to be sworn in as president and vice president. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced after hours of chaos around the white-columned edifice that police had secured the building. Today, a shameful assault was made on our democracy, Pelosi said. It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden, she said. Amidst the violence Biden said he was shocked and sad to see the US has ""come to such a dark moment"". ""At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault. Unlike anything we've seen in modern times. An assault on the citadel of liberty, the Capitol itself. An assault on the people's representatives and the Capitol Hill police, sworn to protect them. And the public servants who work at the heart of our Republic...,"" he said in an address to the nation. ""Let me be very clear. The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America. Do not represent who we are. What we're seeing are a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent. It's disorder. It's chaos. It borders on sedition. And it must end now,"" Biden said. ""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution by demanding an end to this siege,"" he said. Harris also demanded an end to the assault on the US Capitol by the supporters of Trump. I join President-elect Joe Biden in calling for the assault on the Capitol and our nation's public servants to end, and as he said, allow the work of democracy to go forward"", Harris said in a tweet. Trump has refused to concede the election. He alleges that there was a massive voters' fraud and electoral malpractice. Election officials have denied the allegations. All four living former US presidents -- Barack Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter -- condemned the actions of the pro-Trump rioters who forced an evacuation of the House and Senate chambers of the US Capitol and underlined the need for a peaceful transfer of power. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented move, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that President Donald Trump's accounts on its popular social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram - would remain suspended until the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on January 20. Announcing the decision, Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing President Trump to continue to use the platform during this period is ""simply too great.""",theasianage
20,/india/politics/070121/sc-refuses-to-stay-uttarakhand-up-laws-regulating-inter-faith-marriages.html,"SC refuses to stay Uttarakhand, UP laws regulating inter-faith marriages","New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay the Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh laws regulating inter-faith marriages and conversion while issuing notice in two pleas challenging the validity of the laws. Refusing to stay the laws, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said it can’t decide which provisions of the two laws were oppressive unless it hears the state governments concerned. The Uttar Pradesh government has promulgated an ordinance regulating inter-faith marriages and religious conversions and a similar was enacted by the Uttrakhand  in 2018. When advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav pointed out that the BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and Haryana were also bringing laws on the lines of the UP ordinance and society is affected, the CJI said the court would not expand the petitions’ scope. The bench, also comprising Justice A.S. Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanian, however, agreed to examine the validity of the ordinance and the laws. The court was hearing petitions, one by Delhi-based lawyer Vishal Thakre and the another by Mumbai-based NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), challenging the constitutional validity of the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religious Ordinance, 2020, and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018. The petitions under Article 32 stated that the two laws were violative of Articles 21 and 25 as they empower the State to suppress an individual’s liberty and the freedom to practice religion of one's choice. The Uttarakhand law and UP ordinance essentially bar conversion to any other religion for the purpose of marriage. The ordinance lays down a detailed procedure to be followed before an individual can convert from one religion to another. Violation of the same entails criminal liability on the individual who undergoes conversion and the individual who converts the person. The ordinance also states that no person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion. The petitioners submitted that the two laws seemed to be premised on conspiracy theories and assume that all conversions are illegally forced upon individuals, though they have attained the age of majority. It intrudes into the right to privacy under Article 21 and freedom of religion under Article 25, it was contended. The plea also highlighted that the UP ordinance casts the burden of proof on the accused against the established principles of criminal jurisprudence. “The burden of proof gets shifted and it is dangerous as it is a non-bailable offence and also under a circumstance where they are pitched against hostile communities and family members who masquerade in the glory of protection of women,"" one of the petitions said. Initially, CJI Bobde was not in favour of issuing notice after Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta informed the court that both the challenges are pending in the respective High Courts. They however, agreed to hear the [etitions on advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav arguing that the Supreme Court can take up cases which are pending in different High Courts. Objecting to the parties coming straight to the Supreme Court under Article 32, the CJI said: “First you exercise your right under Article 32 by approaching the respective High Courts and come here if you don't get any relief.” Senior advocate C.U. Singh told the court that the legislations under challenge are “obnoxious” in nature and that couples were being picked up by force from wedding places. “We need stay on reverse burden of proof and intimation to police for marriage. Prima facie it’s an oppressive clause. It’s a non-bailable offence. This is there in both Acts. Daily there are reports of people being picked up by force. It is obnoxious to seek prior permission for marriage from a magistrate,” Singh argued.",theasianage

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, which observed that there is no improvement on the ground regarding farmers' protests, was informed by the Centre that healthy discussions are going on between the government and farmers over these issues. Attorney General K K Venugopal said there is a good chance that parties may come to a conclusion in the near future and filing of response by the Centre on the pleas challenging the new farm laws might foreclose the negotiations between the farmers and government. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, while informing the bench that talks are going on between the government and farmers in a healthy atmosphere, said that these matters should not be listed for hearing on January 8. We understand the situation and encourage the consultation. We can adjourn the matters on Monday (January 11) if you submit the same due to the ongoing consultation process, the bench said. The top court was hearing a plea filed by advocate M L Sharma challenging the farm laws. The bench issued notice to the Centre seeking its response on Sharma's plea which has alleged that the Central government has no locus under the Constitution to frame these laws. During the hearing, conducted through video-conferencing, the bench said at the outset, These are farm matters. Where are the other matters? When they are listed? We are going to hear all the matters together. The bench asked Mehta to find out the status of other matters and as to when they are listed. Mehta said that no specific date was given earlier for hearing on these pleas. We are keeping this plea (filed by Sharma) for hearing on Friday and we allow the amended petition to be taken on record in the meanwhile, the bench said. M L Sharma always files startling petitions and he says that the Centre has no power to make laws, the bench observed, adding, Mr Sharma says that you (government) are colluding and making laws. The top court said it would take up the plea along with other pending matters because we think that the condition has not improved already. After Mehta said that talks are going on in healthy atmosphere, the bench said it would take up these matters on January 11. The apex court had earlier issued notice and sought the Centre's response on a batch of pleas against the three contentious farm laws -- Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. While hearing the pleas on the issue of farmers' protest, the top court had on December 17 said that the agitation should be allowed to continue without impediment and this court will not interfere with it as the right to protest is a fundamental right. While acknowledging the right to non-violent protest of farmers, the apex court was also of the view that their right to protest should not infringe the fundamental rights of others to move freely and in getting essential food and other supplies as right to protest cannot mean blockade of the entire city. In its December 17 order, the bench had said: We clarify that this court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact, be exercised subject to public order. There can certainly be no impediment in the exercise of such rights as long as it is non-violent and does not result in damage to the life and properties of other citizens and is in accordance with law. We are of the view at this stage that the farmers' protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police.",theasianage

The national capital, meanwhile, reels under a spell of harsh winter. The city woke up on Wednesday to the rumble of thunder and the sound of hailstones hitting rooftops and windows as it received rainfall for the fourth consecutive day. The rains, caused by a strong western disturbance, come on the back of a ""severe"" cold wave that gripped Delhi in the run-up to New Year. On Friday, the mercury had plummeted to 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in 15 years for January. On Tuesday, the protesting farmers said they were deferring their proposed tractor march from January 6 to January 7 due to a bad weather forecast. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28, demanding repeal of the farm laws, a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops and other two issues. Last week, the government agreed to exclude farmers from penal provisions of the Air Quality Management ordinance and to not pursue the draft Electricity Bill. Since the farmers arrived at the national capital's borders, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.

24,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/donald-trump-capitol-attack-video-new-administration,'Only goal was integrity of vote'  Trump decries violence he incited ,"More than 24 hours after he incited a mob to attack the US Capitol, Donald Trump has urged an end to the violence and finally acknowledged that Joe Biden will be the next president, saying in a video statement that “a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20” and promising a smooth transfer of power. The statement was posted on Twitter – one of the only social media platforms to which the president still has access – following a day of silence after his unprecedented encouragement of rioters bent on insurrection. Hours later, Capitol police confirmed that a police officer had died during the attack on Wednesday. A statement said Brian Sicknick was injured while physically engaging with protesters and an investigation into his death would be carried out. Trump’s statement came amid growing calls for his resignation or removal, and as a growing list of administration figures – including the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and transportation secretary, Elaine Chao – resigned in the wake of the attack. The president began the video with his first straightforward denunciation of the sacking of the US Capitol building, saying that he was “outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem”. Trump also claimed that he had “immediately deployed the national guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders”; although multiple news outlets have reported that it was in fact Mike Pence, not Trump, who deployed the national guard, while Trump resisted the measure. The statement marked a stark reversal in tone for the president, who has continued to stoke unrest and falsely claim that the election had been stolen from him. While stopping short of outright admitting defeat, Trump’s statement is the closest he has come to a concession speech. “My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote,” said Trump, despite no evidence that the election was anything but safe, and assurances by his own attorney general that there was no widespread voter fraud. “Now, Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.” Trump concluded his brief remarks by calling for “healing and reconciliation” and saying that “tempers must be cooled”. He included a final message for his supporters, saying: “I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning.” Trump’s statement came as the threat of a second impeachment loomed and a growing cohort of lawmakers called for him to pay a price for the tumultuous scenes in Washington. On Wednesday, Trump encouraged thousands of supporters to march on the US Capitol to protest the election results, whipping up a mob that overran police officers and invaded the Capitol building, forcing members of Congress into hiding. Four people died, including one woman who was shot and killed by police and three people who died in medical emergencies. The top Democrats in Congress – the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer – have called on the vice-president, Mike Pence, and Trump’s cabinet to use the US Constitution to remove Trump for “his incitement of insurrection”. The 25th amendment allows a majority of the cabinet to remove a president from power if he is unable to discharge the duties of the office. But Schumer and Pelosi said they have yet to hear back from Pence, and a Pence adviser told the Associated Press that the vice-president, who would have to lead any such effort, was opposed to using the amendment. If Pence fails to act, Pelosi signaled she would likely reconvene the House to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump for his role in Wednesday’s violence. A handful of Republicans have also called for Trump’s removal but the party leadership remains more guarded. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has blamed the attack on “unhinged criminals” but not mentioned Trump. Elsewhere the Wall Street Journal, seen as a leading voice of the Republican establishment, also called on Trump to vacate his office. In a Thursday evening editorial, the paper called on the president to resign rather than face impeachment or a forced removal under the 25th amendment. “This was an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election,” the paper’s editorial board wrote of Trump’s actions on Wednesday. “It was also an assault on the legislature from an executive sworn to uphold the laws of the United States. This goes beyond merely refusing to concede defeat. In our view it crosses a constitutional line that Mr Trump hasn’t previously crossed. It is impeachable.” The editorial boards of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and USA Today have also issued similar calls. Several members of Trump’s administration, including DeVos and Chao, who is married to McConnell, resigned as a symbolic gesture against the violence. The US Senate sergeant-at-arms, Michael Stenger, the House sergeant-at-arms, Paul D Irving, and the chief of the US Capitol police, Steven Sund, all resigned on Thursday in the wake of the unprecedented security breach of the Capitol, which has has drawn outrage and scrutiny. Speaking in Delaware on Thursday, Joe Biden called those who stormed the Capitol building “domestic terrorists” . Speaking just hours after Congress certified him the winner of the 2020 election, the president-elect called the previous afternoon’s events “one of the darkest days in the history of our nation”. “They weren’t protesters – don’t dare call them protesters,” Biden said. “They were a riotous mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It’s that basic. It’s that simple.”",theguardian

Get up to speed quickly ","Donald Trump has publicly renounced further efforts to overturn the US election results and have himself returned as president. In a video on his reinstated Twitter account, the president pretended not to have precipitated the violence at the Capitol, saying “My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote” – despite no evidence that the election was unsafe or unfair – and that he was “outraged” by what happened. He called for a smooth and orderly transition of power. Welcome to the Briefing – I’m Warren Murray, here to walk you through the key points. Calls for Trump’s removal from office have continued amid fears of further dangers in the final days of his presidency after he incited a mob to march on the congressional building, which they ransacked, and where five people died including a police officer. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate majority leader following the Democratic sweep of Georgia, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, have called for Trump to be dismissed immediately and replaced by the vice-president through the 25th amendment to the constitution; or failing that, impeached for a second time. Pelosi described Trump as “a very dangerous person who should not continue in office … This is urgent. This is an emergency of the highest magnitude.” Several Democratic members of Congress drafted new articles of impeachment for inciting Wednesday’s violence and trying to subvert US democracy. The Trump-backing Wall Street Journal’s editorial board has called for his resignation. The education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has become the second person in Trump’s cabinet to resign, following on from the transportation secretary, Elaine Chao. DeVos said the attack on the Capitol was unconscionable and told Trump: “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation and it is the inflection point for me.” The American Federation of Teachers issued a pithy two-word statement on DeVos’s departure: “Good riddance.” Trump’s special envoy to Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, said he was leaving and told CNN: “Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they’re worried the president might put someone worse in.” The chief of the Capitol Police, who are supposed to protect the congressional building, has resigned, while the top protection officials for the House and the Senate have also been forced out amid anger and disbelief that their security was so easily overrun. Trump has been banned from Facebook indefinitely, although experts say social networks have acted four years too late. Cleric of Bali bombers freed – The radical Islamist preacher suspected of masterminding the Bali bombings has been released from prison in Indonesia. Abu Bakar Bashir, 82, is considered the spiritual leader of militant group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) whose 2002 terrorist attack killed more than 200 people, most of them foreign tourists. The preacher had completed an unrelated jail term for helping fund militant training in conservative Aceh province. But he has long been suspected of involvement in the holiday island bombings, Indonesia’s worst terror attack. Covid test rule for arrivals – International travellers will need to show a negative Covid-19 test before being allowed into the UK, the government has announced. The rule will apply from next week to returning UK nationals as well as foreign citizens. They will all still need to quarantine for 10 days, even with a negative test, unless from low-risk countries on the UK’s travel corridor list. Moderna’s Covid vaccine is likely to be approved for use in Britain next week but the 7m doses ordered by the government will not start becoming available until April, because of Brexit. Inspectors have uncovered serious weaknesses in some care homes’ pandemic defences, including Covid-positive carers being told to work because of staff shortages, a failure to isolate residents returning from hospital and poor use of PPE. Boris Johnson has pledged to immunise every elderly care home resident by the end of the month. The lockdown in Wales is to continue for at least three more weeks. Musk racks it up – Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, has overtaken Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to become the world’s richest person. Shares in Tesla have soared on hopes a Democrat-controlled US Senate will usher in a new green agenda. The 49-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth hit $186bn (£136bn) at 10.15am in New York on Wednesday, making him $1.5bn richer than Bezos, who had held the top spot since October 2017. Musk responded to the news of his status as the world’s richest person with tweets stating “how strange” and “well, back to work”. UK hits the home button – British consumers spent a record £9bn on entertainment in 2020 as the pandemic fuelled a boom in the popularity of digital services such as Netflix, Amazon and Spotify while the public sought to alleviate lockdown boredom. Overall spending on entertainment, which covers digital and physical video, music and gaming including sales of CDs, DVDs and video games software, soared by 17% year-on-year in 2020 – the fastest annual rate in the 25 years the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA) has been compiling figures. Frozen II was the best selling video, with Fifa 21 topping the game charts and Lewis Capaldi’s Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent the biggest album.

Our Friday print edition of the Guardian leads with “Democrats seek to remove Trump after ‘darkest’ day”. While the Metro blares “Lock him up!” amid calls for the president’s removal and more. The Telegraph’s splash headline expands that theme: “Remove Trump or we will: Democrat threat after America’s day of shame”. The i has “Trump faces wrath of America” which might be considered debatable; “Biden attacks Trump over Capitol riot” says the Financial Times. “Trump must go or we will impeach” – that’s the Democratic party position on the front of the Times, though its splash is “New hope for Covid patients”, reporting news that arthritis medications might be life-saving for some of the critically ill. “You’re fired” says the Mail, to Trump, because somebody had to do that one. That’s the picture lead – the splash is “Boris battle plan for jabs” as the army swings in to help. “A shot in the army” says the Mirror while its picture lead is “A dark day in American history”, showing congressional staffers holed up during the rioting. “Call to arms” says the Sun, once again about the army helping with vaccinations, while the Express combines that with the arthritis drug news, hailing them jointly as “Lifesavers!”.

26,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/08/climate-crisis-experts-2020-joint-hottest-year-ever-recorded,Climate crisis  2020 was joint hottest year ever recorded ,"The climate crisis continued unabated in 2020, with the the joint highest global temperatures on record, alarming heat and record wildfires in the Arctic, and a record 29 tropical storms in the Atlantic. Despite a 7% fall in fossil fuel burning due to coronavirus lockdowns, heat-trapping carbon dioxide continued to build up in the atmosphere, also setting a new record. The average surface temperature across the planet in 2020 was 1.25C higher than in the pre-industrial period of 1850-1900, dangerously close to the 1.5C target set by the world’s nations to avoid the worst impacts. Only 2016 matched the heat in 2020, but that year saw a natural El Niño climate event which boosts temperatures. Without that it is likely 2020 would have been the outright hottest year. Scientists have warned that without urgent action the future for many millions of people “looks black”. The temperature data released by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) showed that the past six years have been the hottest six on record. They also showed that Europe saw its hottest year on record, 1.6C above the long-term average, with a searing heatwave hitting western Europe in late July and early August. The Arctic and northern Siberia saw particularly extreme average temperatures in 2020, with a large region 3C higher than the long-term average and some locations more than 6C higher. This resulted in extensive wildfires, with a record 244m tonnes of CO2 released within the Arctic Circle. Arctic sea ice was also significantly lower, with July and October seeing the smallest extent on record for those months. “[The year] 2020 stands out for its exceptional warmth in the Arctic,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S. “It is no surprise that the last decade was the warmest on record, and is yet another reminder of the urgency of ambitious emissions reductions to prevent adverse climate impacts.” “The extraordinary climate events of 2020 show us we have no time to lose,” said Matthias Petschke, at the European commission. “It will be difficult, but the cost of inaction is too great.” “Despite the absence of the cyclical boost of El Niño to global temperatures [we are] getting dangerously close to the 1.5C limit,” said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “Covid lockdowns around the world may have caused a slight dip in emissions, but the CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere is still going up fast. Unless the global economic recovery from the nightmares of 2020 is a green one, the future of many millions of people around the world looks black indeed.” The level of CO2 in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020, with the cut in emissions due to Covid lockdowns described as a “tiny blip” by the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation. Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, said: “Until the net global emissions reduce to zero, CO2 will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere and drive further climate change.” The UK Met Office issued a forecast on Friday that CO2 levels will pass a new milestone in 2021 – being 50% higher than before the Industrial Revolution. Its scientists said CO2 will exceed 417 parts per million (ppm) for several weeks from April to June, which is 50% higher than the 278 ppm in the late 18th century when industrial activity began. This is despite the expectation that weather conditions brought by the counterpart of El Niño, La Niña, will see higher natural growth in tropical forests that will soak up some of humanity’s emissions. “The human-caused buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere is accelerating,” said Prof Richard Betts at the Met Office. “It took over 200 years for levels to increase by 25%, but now just over 30 years later we are approaching a 50% increase. Global emissions will need to be brought down to net zero within about the next 30 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C.”",theguardian

Overall spending on entertainment, which covers digital and physical video, music and gaming including sales of CDs, DVDs and video games software, soared by 17% year-on-year in 2020 – the fastest annual rate in the 25 years the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA) has been compiling figures. Frozen II was the best selling video, with Fifa 21 topping the game charts and Lewis Capaldi’s Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent the biggest album. The figures highlight how the pandemic has accelerated the pace of the shift in consumer habits away from physical products, with a record £7.8bn spent on digital-delivered services, accounting for 86% of total UK entertainment spend last year. Spending on digital video services, led by Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon’s Prime Video, surged by 38% year-on-year to £2.9bn, by far the fastest-growing sector of the UK entertainment market. Last year proved the biggest ever for new UK subscribers to streaming services, hitting 32m, more than double the number signed up to traditional pay-TV providers such as Sky, BT TV and Virgin Media. This week Netflix, the UK’s most biggest streaming service with 13 million UK subscribers, raised its prices, with its most popular package increasing by £1 per month to £9.99. Disney’s Frozen II sold 973,000 copiesincluding renting and buying or downloading a copy physically or digitally – as families sought to keep their children entertained while stuck at home. Overall, the physical and digital music market rose 6.8% to £1.5bn, with Lewis Capaldi producing the most popular album of the year of the pandemic, with total sales of 455,900. The total digital and physical games market grew 14.5% to £4.2bn last year wit FIFA 21 shifting 2.18m copies. Music streaming revenues leapt by more than 15% to £1.2bn as a rush of new subscribers to services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music pushed the overall music market to £1.5bn – the highest level since 2006. Music streaming revenues are now bigger than the entire music market was worth as recently as 2016. Earlier this week the industry body the BPI revealed the amount of music streamed last year rose 22% last year to 139bn audio streams, up from 114bn in 2019. The trend was the same in gaming, by far the largest segment of the overall UK entertainment market, which saw a 16% rise in spend on mobile and streamed games to £3.6bn. “If there was ever a year in which we needed entertainment, it was 2020,” said Kim Bayley, the chief executive of the ERA. “The trend towards an increasingly digital entertainment market may be long established, but no one could have foreseen this dramatic leap as digital services filled the gap left by shuttered cinemas, concert halls and retail stores.” Last year, UK consumers spent almost £150m less on physical entertainment products, such as buying and renting DVDs and CDs. Total sales of physical entertainment products fell by 10.7% last year, from £1.4bn to £1.2bn. In just a decade the physicals entertainment market has shrunk by three-quarters, from £4.7bn in 2010. The closure of high street stores exacerbated the downward spiral of sales of most physical products last year. Sales of music CDs plummeted 28% to £156m while DVD and Blu-ray disc sales fell by a quarter to £355m. And the UK’s physical video rental market is edging closer to disappearing completely, falling 28% to just £16.9m. However, the lockdown proved to be a boon for the vinyl market, which enjoyed its best year in decades as fans deprived of going to gigs diverted their spare cash to their record collections. Sales of vinyl, which has seen a revival in recent years, rose 13% to £110m, and rather remarkably now accounts for 40% of the total £271m physical music market.Overall, the physical and digital music market rose 6.8% to £1.5bn.",theguardian
28,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/08/covid-billionaires-should-help-starving-people-says-charity-boss,"Covid windfall  Billionaires should help starving people, says charity boss ","Billionaires whose wealth has soared during the coronavirus pandemic should stump up to provide emergency aid to the record numbers of people facing starvation, the head of a US charity supporting the World Food Programme has said. The pandemic and ensuing economic crisis have contributed to a sharp rise in the number of people on the brink of starvation around the world. The WFP, the UN agency that provides emergency relief, was needed by 138 million people last year, up from about 100 million in 2019. That figure is expected to increase again this year, to about 235 million people “marching toward starvation”, according to Barron Segar, the president and chief executive of the World Food Program USA. “Without doubt, we are facing the largest humanitarian assistance programme in history.” But the funds the WFP has available are not increasing at the same rate, and Segar estimates that the shortfall will reach about $5bn (£3.7bn) this year. “Imagine one person to stand up and say they have heard the call, they will donate $5bn,” he told the Guardian. “We are trying to unlock the private sector. There are more billionaires in the US than we have ever had before, and many billionaires are successful because of Covid.” He warned that despite the distribution of vaccines, the pandemic and economic crises were showing no signs of releasing their grip on the world. “Things are going to get worse,” he said. “My crystal ball looks very bleak. More people will die not because of Covid, but because of the economic fallout from Covid.” People in some of the countries worst stricken by starvation, including Afghanistan, Yemen and Burkina Faso, have suffered less from the virus itself than the indirect impacts. For instance, as developed economies around the world have taken an economic hit, the diaspora of these countries who would normally send remittances home have had less money to do so. Added to that are problems with getting governments with budget shortfalls to commit more economic aid, and the increased difficulties of reaching people in remote areas because of travel restrictions imposed due to Covid. These problems come on top of conflicts and natural disasters such as locust swarms in east Africa, as well as long-term difficulties such as worsening climatic conditions, which have combined to push people to the brink of starvation. Last year’s efforts, when the WFP reached 97 million people in the first nine months, were “wonderful news”, said Segar, but he warned that “we have only postponed disaster”. The World Food Programme, which was established in 1961, was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year in recognition of its decades of work relieving hunger. In its citation, the Nobel committee said: “The world is in danger of experiencing a hunger crisis of inconceivable proportions if the World Food Program and other food assistance organisations do not receive the financial support they have requested.” Segar said he was taking the unprecedented step of asking for an individual billionaire, or small number of donors, to come forward because he could see little other prospect of filling the funding gap. “Hunger is solvable,” he said. “This can be solved with significant support from ultra high net worth individuals.” Segar declined to name any individual billionaires, but several of the world’s richest people have seen their fortunes soar with the impacts of the virus and lockdowns across the world. Amazon has benefited from the massive increase in online shopping, while usage of Facebook and Twitter has leapt as people spend more time online and work from home. Shares in Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, have risen in value as conventional carmakers and oil companies have suffered. Musk has now overtaken Jeff Bezos of Amazon as the world’s richest person. The Financial Times newspaper recently identified 100 companies that have enjoyed rising fortunes during the pandemic, including Apple, Microsoft, PayPal and Visa among the top 15 risers by market capitalisation. Stock markets reached new highs late last year, despite the pandemic, as governments poured money into propping up the global economy. While some billionaires, such as Bill Gates of Microsoft and MacKenzie Scott, the former wife of the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, have resolved to devote most of their vast fortunes to philanthropy, most seem reluctant to link their rising wealth with the pandemic. Several companies contacted by the Guardian declined to say whether their billionaire founders would respond to Segar’s call, but pointed to philanthropic work they have undertaken. Google said it had provided $800m to small businesses, as well as $100m towards Covid relief from its philanthropy arm, Google.org. Amazon pointed to Bezos’s donation of $100m last year to Feeding America, and his 2018 launch of the $2bn Day One Fund, focused on homelessness and preschooling. The US provides much of the funding to the WFP, and under president-elect Joe Biden may take greater interest in its programmes. The UK slashed its overseas aid last year, to the consternation of many development experts. Last year, the WFP executive director, David Beasley, warned the Guardian of “famine of biblical proportions” because of natural disasters and conflicts, compounded with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.",theguardian
29,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jan/08/uk-covid-school-closures-mean-mothers-will-take-twice-as-much-unpaid-leave-as-fathers-poll,UK school closures  Mothers will take twice as much unpaid leave as fathers – poll ,"Twice as many mothers as fathers say they will have to take time off with no pay due to school closures or a sick child, according to a survey, raising further fears that the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic is falling disproportionately on women’s shoulders. According to the survey, carried out by a group of women’s organisations across the UK including Women’s Budget Group and the Fawcett Society, 15% of mothers said they had to take unpaid time off work, compared with 8% of fathers, while 57% of fathers said they would be able to work from home during school closures, compared with 49% of mothers. “With England now in lockdown and strong restrictions in the devolved nations, parents of school-age children working from home will be struggling once more to combine lesson supervision with paid work,” said Dr Mary Ann Stephenson, the director of Women’s Budget Group. “Mothers are more at risk of having to take time off on no pay when schools close.” At the end of October, there were 1.19 million women furloughed, compared with 1.14 million men, with women making up over 51% of those on the job retention scheme. But the gender disparity was much greater for young women, who made up 57% of furloughed under-18s and 53% of furloughed 18-24-year-olds, according to Guardian analysis. Among women aged 24 and under there were 196,800 jobs furloughed, compared with 172,400 for men of the same age, a difference of around 14%. Initial HMRC analysis also appears to show that women were more likely to be let go after the furlough scheme ended, with 91% of previously furloughed men back on their original payroll as of August, compared with 89% of women. Overall, around 10% of those formerly on the furlough scheme were no longer working for their employer at the end of August. A recent report from the Young Women’s Trust found that 1.5 million young women had lost income since the pandemic, 69% who claimed benefits did so for the first time, and 750,000 had to go to work despite fears for their safety. “Young women on low pay were already struggling to get by before the pandemic hit and since then many lost earnings because of furlough, redundancy or because they had to juggle precarious and insecure work with caring responsibilities,” said Abi Shapiro, the interim chief executive of Young Women’s Trust. Gemma Hirst, 25, was furloughed in March from the retail job she had worked in for six years. The store she worked in did not reopen, and in June she was offered just four hours a week in a different store despite having worked as a supervisor previously. Not able to survive on the hours, she had to go on universal credit for the first time. “When it comes to it, actually, you’re just a number, they don’t care about you at all,” said Hirst. The figures have raised fears that young women are at particular risk of having their economic futures and mental health blighted. Recent research from Agenda, which campaigns for women and girls at risk, found a quarter of young women were suffering symptoms of depression or anxiety, three times the rate of young males, and one in five young women with severe money problems had self-harmed in the past year. It raised concerns that young BAME women were particularly at risk. “Our concern is that we are creating a future mental health epidemic among young women,” said Jess Southgate, CEO of Agenda. A May report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the UCL Institute of Education revealed that mothers in England were more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during lockdown, and were only able to do only one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by men. The new Survation survey of 1,308 parents in the UK with children aged 14 and under found that parents with an annual household income of £20,000 or below were nine times more likely to say their jobs were at risk because of school closures than parents with an annual household income of £40,000 or above – with 9% of low-income parents reporting this compared with 1% of those earning over £40,000. Twelve per cent of parents earning below £20,000 a year and 13% of parents earning between £20,000 and £40,000 a year said they would have to take time off on no pay if schools closed or their children had to self-isolate, compared with 7% of parents earning more than £40,000 annually. The TUC has asked companies to “do the right thing” and allow staff to furlough for childcare, as well as offering the right to flexible working and 10 days’ paid parental leave a year. “Without further action, many will have no choice but to cut their hours or take unpaid leave from work. This will lead to further hardship and will hit mums and single parents hardest,” said the TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady. Felicia Willow, the Fawcett Society’s interim chief executive, said that there had been positive developments since the introduction of the job retention scheme such as the right to take furlough for childcare reasons, as well as the ability for furlough to be shared between parents but said the government needed to urgently put in place a rescue package for the childcare sector and carry out an equality impact assessment. “But women remain on the sidelines of the government’s coronavirus response,” she said. “We urge the government to put women at the centre of its decision-making.”",theguardian

The company, a major provider of timetabled coach routes, said it would be halting all services until March. Chris Hardy, the managing director of National Express UK Coach, said: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.” All journeys until Sunday night will run as planned to ensure that no passengers making essential journeys are stranded, National Express said, while customers whose travel has been cancelled will be contacted for free rebooking or full refunds. Hardy said there was a provisional restart date of 1 March in place but warned that could change: “As the vaccination programme is rolled out and government guidance changes, we will regularly review when we can restart services. “We will now make sure we are ready to get back behind the wheel as soon as the nation needs us again.” National Express suspended its coach operations for almost three months from April 2020 in the first lockdown. While local bus operations have been underwritten by a government bailout, which is giving operators assistance equivalent to lost revenue, intercity coach services have not had similar financial guarantees. Since the start of the pandemic National Express has launched a division called Transport Solutions to use its brand and coaches in the vastly changed market. The withdrawal of coach services comes as the Department for Transport and train operators consider which rail services will be withdrawn, with around 50% of the timetable likely to be suspended during the lockdown.",theguardian

On Thursday morning Hancock said doses of the vaccine were being supplied to GP practices across the country as he visited the Bloomsbury surgery in central London. However, he conceded the “rate-limiting” factor in efforts to get people vaccinated was supply from the manufacturers. Standing in front of Dr Ammara Hughes’s surgery, the health secretary said: “It’s great news this morning that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is from right now being rolled out to GP surgeries across the country. “For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine, we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well, and it’s working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed. “The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We’re working with the companies – both Pfizer and AstraZeneca – to increase the supply.” It was confirmed on Thursday evening that the surgery he visited later took delivery of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Hancock’s visit to the surgery was akin to a scene from political satire The Thick of It, but added: “Sadly, it’s no laughing matter.” He tweeted: “This should be a clear reminder to ministers to move and heaven [sic] to get vaccination widely rolled out ASAP. We’re in a race against time and we need to start with 2 million jabs a week urgently.” Dr Hughes said Hancock was “quite surprised actually to learn that we don’t know when all of our deliveries are coming, they’re very ad hoc”. The surgery has been administering the Pfizer vaccine since the middle of December and has so far received three deliveries. Dr Hughes added: “So we’ve continued to vaccinate with Pfizer in the surgery, and what we’re hoping to do with the AstraZeneca when it arrives is to go out to the most clinically vulnerable and housebound. So that’s what we’ll be doing. “We won’t start vaccinating within the surgery with our AstraZeneca doses until we’ve finished our Pfizer vaccines.” Both AstraZeneca and Pfizer have said they are on track to deliver vaccines as agreed with the government. The government announced nearly 1.5 million people had now been inoculated against Covid-19. PA Media contributed to this report",theguardian
32,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/08/wealthy-london-home-food-bank-hotspot-naomi-russell-property-pandemic,'It's not what people expect'  How one wealthy London home became a food bank hotspot ,"It is not what you would expect to find on one of the most expensive streets in the country. But these are unusual times. Naomi Russell has transformed her multimillion-pound home overlooking Hampstead Heath, north London, into a food bank distribution centre, helping hundreds of people struggling to feed their families during the coronavirus pandemic. A pink gazebo dominates Russell’s driveway and acts as a drop-off point for donations. Her car and her husband’s have been shunted out of the double garage to make way for hundreds of boxes storing everything from pasta and fresh fruit to chocolate and exotic spices. And, most importantly, Russell says, box upon box of toiletries, loo roll, nappies and baby milk formula. “It’s not what people expect to encounter around here, that’s true,” Russell said of her makeshift food warehouse on Millfield Lane that winds its way from Highgate West Hill towards the wild swimming ponds on the heath. “Because of where we are right by the heath, we sometimes have 100-200 people a day spotting us and coming in here to see what’s going on. No one expects to find a food bank distribution centre here.” Russell said she decided to do something to help people struggling with the fallout of the pandemic early on in the crisis. “It was terrible to see what was happening, and the lack of government support. We had to do something,” she said. “Hundreds of people were suddenly out of work, and literally couldn’t put food on the table. People who would have had a salary, now have nothing, and have to wait six weeks to get into the benefit system.” The heavy footfall of walkers passing Russell’s home has been ideal for recruiting volunteers to help with collecting, organising and delivering supplies to 15 nearby food banks. “I’ve met all my neighbours now, right up down and round the street. Many of them are helping out,” Russell said. “And then there are all the walkers and joggers out on the heath. People will see us working, and wonder – like you did – what’s going on here? They come over and have chat, they are very surprised that this a food bank donation spot. They don’t think of that sort of thing happening here. “They will see me working and ask about the house. They are often very shocked. I don’t think they expect the person who owns this house to be working in a food bank.” Russell said during the first lockdown she would see a jogger at precisely 07:30 every day, and sometimes again at 19:30 when he would head out on a then-rule-breaking second jog. “After a few weeks he stopped and asked, ‘What are you doing out here all day?’. I told him, and now he is one of most dedicated volunteers.” Russell is not alone in turning her home into a food bank collection point. She formed Food Bank Aid, which supplies food and essential items to food banks across north London, with Jo Rosenblatt. A dozen other homes in the area also act as drop-off points. Similar grassroots charitable ventures have formed across the country. But Russell’s stands out as unique because of its position on a street where homes change hands for more than £6m. More than 1.2m emergency food parcels were distributed by the Trussell Trust, the largest food bank network, between April and the end of September – a 47% increase and the busiest ever half-year period for food banks. Emma Revie, the chief executive of the trust, said: “Throughout 2020, communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money. “Volunteers in food banks have been working hard under extremely difficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials. But it’s not right that any of us are forced to a charity for food, at any time of year. Russell and Rosenblatt said they had at times been overwhelmed by the generosity of people donating supplies, particularly during the October half-term when the government had refused to provide free holiday lunches despite a high-profile campaign by the England footballer Marcus Rashford. “During the Marcus Rashford period it went absolutely insane,” Russell said. “We got more than double we usually did. In fact there was a day when I actually had to say to people can you keep it and bring stuff in the next few weeks instead. We had queues of cars waiting to drop stuff off.” They said many people would do two weekly shops at the supermarket – one for their own household and one to donate to the food bank. Others order groceries online to be delivered directly to Russell’s home. “One Ocado man said it was the biggest order he had ever delivered,” Russell said. “It was half of his entire truck.” The Ocado driver was so struck by Russell’s work that he also volunteers doing deliveries for the food bank in his spare time. One of the centres supplied by Russell and Rosenblatt is Finchley food bank, three miles to the north. Anna Maughan, who runs it, said the service was supplying more than double the number of households it was catering to before the pandemic. “We’ve never been so busy,” Maughan said. “We started with a handful of households, but it just grew and grew and now we regularly support 50 households.” During the summer, 110 households queued for supplies. “There has been a huge rise in people who are desperate for support. It is people on zero-contract-type hours, the people who were just getting by prior to the pandemic and are no longer getting by not getting by at all,” she said. “It’s anyone that didn’t have a buffer. Some of them are people that would never have expected to come to a food bank, but now have no choice. We have also seen big rise in people seeking support who have entered a refuge.” The food banks said they had received enough items to support families over Christmas, the time of year when people were most generous in providing donations. But they fear supplies could now run low, when donations dwindle as many people discover the size of their Christmas credit card bill. “It is in January and February that donations go down but client numbers go up,” Maughan said. “It’s when the bills come in and when the heating and electric costs go up. At the same time donations go down because everyone has overspent. If people would like to donate, it would be great if they could do so [during this period].”",theguardian

  Why has Britain become numb to the horror of deaths caused by incompetence? ","Shockability is a primal quality. Lose that, and you lose all humanity. Latest figures say there have been 93,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. I am trying to imagine how high 93,000 stacked coffins would reach, or how deep a plague pit would be to hold 93,000 bodies. Because they are disposed of decorously out of sight, there are no such gruesome pictures to jolt the senses. The Guardian has done its best to remember some of the people who have died of Covid: their stories, those family tragedies. Yet still there’s something missing, in a national sense of the true horror that has descended on us. A plane crash, an earthquake, wildfires, the twin towers falling – those shockingly visual news events immediately clutch the heart. These pandemic deaths outpace those from the blitz and flying bombs (estimated at 61,000 deaths), yet somehow, the ONS daily tolling the bell for our fast-rising dear departed hasn’t shaken the country enough. A wilful denial clings to the alienating reassurance that the dead are all old, unhealthy or with “underlying conditions” – even though some of those “conditions” turn out to be far too mild to account for a death. Regardless of age, hundreds of thousands of very good life years are being lost, as measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs), the figure used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to estimate life-saving value in drugs and treatments. Back in August’s phoney Covid peace, in our eat-out-to-help-out madness moment, the ONS was estimating the health impacts of contracting Covid-19: “between March 2020 and March 2021, these represent 570,000 lost QALYs”. Projecting ahead over five years, the ONS found “the impacts of lockdown and a resulting recession are estimated to reduce England’s health by over 970,000 QALYs”. But that was before the second, and now third, wave of the virus, with present infection rates surpassing 2020 highs, hospitals at bursting point and a likely three-month lockdown which will cause further loss of QALYs. What should shock us to the marrow is how many of those lost good years could have been saved. That’s not new news, as numerous scientists, including those on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), have said thousands of lives would have been saved with an early March lockdown, when Boris Johnson still larked about shaking hands. The timeline of failure to act is too painfully familiar to rehearse, but that summer photo of maskless Rishi Sunak serving food to customers taking his bribes to go out breathing on each other in restaurants may be career-defining. Does it shock enough now, looking back? The government’s deadly repetition of the same blunders should shock; all that dither, delay and deference to the lunatic libertarian fringe who continuously argue against lockdowns. What swayed Johnson to close schools between Sunday’s The Andrew Marr show and Monday’s U-turn? The polling, No 10’s own and the likes of Savanta Comres finding 79% of the public back the lockdown, only 9% against: the people are wiser than the rightwing headbangers. Last September, Michael Heseltine captured Johnson’s leadership style: he “waits to see the way the crowd is running and then dashes in front”. Even so, the country seems not yet sufficiently shocked by its prime minister, nor by thousands needlessly dead. They knew what they were getting when they elected Johnson, and his party is still level pegging with Labour in the polls. In other words, Britain’s shockability seems a bit weak. Everyone sees the test and trace fiasco (test results never even arrived for some of my Covid-stricken family – on phoning to find out more, they were told “they often get lost”), despite vast sums of money spent on private companies. Failure of that “moonshot” suggests that it’s optimistic to hope the vaccine will be delivered to timetable: GPs are already cancelling vaccination sessions, held back by lack of promised supply. Airports, meanwhile, remain wide open to any infected new arrivals, while Priti Patel chases headlines over a handful of far less dangerous people to deport. Numerous Covid contracts have gone to companies and individuals with connections to the Conservative party, while elsewhere Tory donors are given peerages or the BBC chair, but all seem to fall below the national shock threshold. Are we inured to it, is this who we are? The pandemic lifts social paving stones to reveal the depths of deprivation among children. How can 1.3 million children have no access to laptops and wifi after nine months of missed schooling? It takes the great Marcus Rashford to force a grudging minimal recognition by the government of child hunger. But the needle on the shock-o-meter over Britain’s gross poverty and inequality moves slowly: Opinium polling for Compassion in Politics records a little improvement – half think that poverty is the result of the system, 24% think it’s the fault of the individual; while 66% think benefits should cover the cost of food, housing and bills. Ipsos Mori finds only 59% support keeping the £20 extra on universal credit after April. Is that enough to prompt action from the perennial crowd-follower Johnson? Yes, probably. Those who claim to put the economy first might be shocked by this week’s annual Financial Times survey of 90 leading economists: not only is Britain top of the EU charts for infections and deaths, but our economy will be slowest to return to pre-pandemic levels, due to Covid and Brexit mismanagement. Reading many of these stories in the Guardian means you may not be deficient in shockability but, as yet, such feelings don’t seem to be shared quite so widely. While the grotesque events in the US of Donald Trump’s last days in power lend our own government a little comparative edge, the deadbeat incompetence of cabinet ministers at the most basic tasks should by now have the whole country aghast, astounded and shocked to the very core at what we have become.

34,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/07/phil-nevilles-miami-move-would-mark-another-door-being-held-open-for-him,"  


  Miami move would be another door held open for Neville ","Farewell then, Phil Neville. Again. Nine months after he agreed to leave his position as manager of the England women’s team, one of the country’s longest goodbyes finally nears completion. Contact has been made with Inter Miami, the now-managerless MLS club part-owned by his former teammate David Beckham, and after three fidgety years the end of the Neville era finally appears to be upon us. If he does take the job, then perhaps it is an appropriate moment to reflect on Neville’s journey in coaching, a trajectory that at the relatively young age of 43 has already landed him a number of coveted positions. England Under-21s, Manchester United, Valencia, Salford City, England women – and now, it seems, Miami. Just how does he keep doing it? Clearly, given his conspicuous lack of success in most of these roles, the only possible conclusion is that Neville must be one hell of an interviewee – the sort of guy that walks into a room and just charms people. Of course, it helps when the people you are trying to charm are old friends like Beckham. Or former managers such as David Moyes at United. Or your brother Gary at Valencia. Or yourself, as co-owner of Salford. Or when you are offered the job without even applying, as with England. The defining motif of Neville’s coaching career to date is a series of doors being held open for him: a path that ironically enough would not exist for a woman of his equivalent talent. Still, in his inimitable capacity to keep falling into ever more lucrative jobs, Neville has demonstrated a defiance of meritocracy that will reward him well beyond football. Expect him to turn up as foreign secretary in about a decade. This isn’t having your cake and eating it. It’s having your cake, eating it and demanding more cake And so to Neville’s tenure itself: a reign of two halves, characterised by 18 months of genuine progress and 18 months of flaky atrophy, hinging around that fateful World Cup semi-final against the USA in Lyon in July 2019. To this day England will mourn Steph Houghton’s missed penalty and the marginal VAR call that denied Ellen White the chance to equalise at 2-2. To run the world’s best team so close was a credit to the entire squad, as well as the sweeping culture changes that Neville had instituted. A progressive 4-2-3-1 system was embedded and drilled, talent identified and integrated, young players such as Keira Walsh and Beth Mead given their chance. And though questions remained over Neville’s selections, tactics and game management, France 2019 had the feeling of a springboard, a platform from which to launch a spirited campaign on home soil at Euro 2021. At which point: enter the drift. Three wins in 10 games since the 2019 World Cup only tells a partial story, given that most were friendlies with an experimental feel. But even accounting for the cold stasis of the pandemic, a sensation of waste and regression surrounds this England team: one that for all its youth and ability still feels less than the sum of its parts. The midfield remains hollow, leaden, lacking in craft. The goalkeeping situation remains unresolved. The lack of a distinct identity or playing pattern will become cripplingly apparent against elite opposition. And on some level it is hard not to connect this with Neville’s apparent loss of interest in the job, one that has coincided with increasingly frequent appearances on Match of the Day to talk about men’s football. Not having any actual games to coach clearly hasn’t helped. But the announcement of Inter Miami’s interest in Neville – and vice versa, by all accounts – is merely the culmination of a process that has been in train ever since the announcement of his departure in April. In hindsight, Neville should probably have gone then. Perhaps even earlier, given the mess his departure has created. A successor, Sarina Wiegman – who did apply for the job – has already been identified. Neville’s insistence that he still wants to lead Team GB into this summer’s Olympics rings hollow now we know that he has been casting around for alternative work. This isn’t just having your cake and eating it. It’s having your cake, eating it, and then insisting on more cake while you eye up the plate of profiteroles on the next table. Let’s remind ourselves that back in 2018, Neville was unequivocal about his commitment to women’s football when he took the job. He denied that this was simply a stepping stone to a first managerial role in the men’s game. Even so, the clues were there when he described the move as “the right development path for me”. And of course it was. The kudos. The exposure. The profile. The instant wave of goodwill. The relative lack of tribalism and scrutiny. It was a dream opening. And of course to a large extent management is about self-projection: about picking your moment, about choosing the right wave to ride at the right time. As he continues to negotiate a move to Inter Miami – a club that doesn’t even have a women’s team – we can conclude with some certainty that Phil Neville got what he wanted out of women’s football. Whether women’s football got what it wanted out of Phil Neville is a far thornier question.",theguardian
35,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/07/consumer-finances-at-risk-as-4000-city-firms-face-collapse-in-covid-crisis,"Economy  Consumer finances at risk as 4,000 City firms face collapse in Covid crisis ","About 4,000 City firms are at a heightened risk of failure due to the Covid crisis, and nearly a third of those businesses could potentially harm consumers if they collapsed, the financial watchdog has warned. A Financial Conduct Authority survey designed to gauge the financial resilience of nearly 23,000 regulated firms showed that the the financial stresses caused by the first wave of the outbreak may cause “significant numbers of firms to fail over the next 12 months”, unless the UK economy starts to recover. The regulator said insurance intermediaries and brokers, payments and electronic money firms, and investment management companies experienced the largest drop in cash and assets, which can act as a buffer during a downturn. Sheldon Mills, the FCA’s executive director in charge of consumers and competition, said the situation was “unprecedented – and rapidly evolving”. “A market downturn driven by the pandemic risks significant numbers of firms failing. At the end of October we’ve identified there are 4,000 financial services firms with low financial resilience and at heightened risk of failure, though many will be able to bolster their resilience as and when economic conditions improve,” Mills said. “These are predominantly small and medium-sized firms and approximately 30% have the potential to cause harm in failure,” he added. Nearly 60% of all firms surveyed said they expected the Covid crisis to hurt their income, with nearly 700 firms forecasting it would fall by more than than two-thirds due to the pandemic. The FCA explained that disorderly failures could hurt consumers, for example by reducing competition, as well as harming “the effectiveness of markets, and overall confidence in the UK’s financial system”. The survey included insurance agents and brokers, the investment management sector, retail lenders, crowdfunders, debt collectors and high-cost loan providers, as well as wholesale financial market players like brokers and exchanges. The number of firms facing failure are much higher than originally estimated. In September, Britain’s financial watchdog warned that hundreds of small and medium-sized firms could collapse due to the economic pressures sparked by the Covid pandemic. However, the FCA cautioned that the survey results were collected before the approval and rollout of Covid vaccines, the extension of the government’s furlough scheme to 30 April, or fresh lockdown measures. The latest survey excludes the UK’s 1,500 largest financial firms, which are monitored by the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority. But the FCA would still be under pressure to prove it did its best protect investors affected by any company failures in light of the scathing reports into its handling of London Capital and Finance ahead of the firm’s collapse. Last month, an independent inquiry found that the FCA failed to properly supervise the mini-bond provider, which wiped out the savings of thousands of people after it went under in 2019.",theguardian

The outlook for trading “remains very challenging” because the latest lockdown could last until Easter, the retailer said. Sales of clothing and homeware slumped by 24.1% in the 13 weeks to 26 December. The figure reflected a near halving of store sales, which was partially offset by a similar-sized surge in online sales. The restrictions on socialising over Christmas meant that the big sellers were pyjamas and jogging bottoms rather than party outfits. Marks & Spencer’s food halls fared better, with sales at stores open one year up 2.6%. That figure rose to almost 6% when the impact of the closure of its large network of in-store cafes was stripped out. On the same basis, sales were up 8.7% in the four weeks before Christmas when the impact of closures was removed. Steve Rowe, the chief executive, said the company’s performance was “robust”, given the “on-off restrictions” and big changes in what shoppers were buying. He added that “beneath the Covid clouds” was a very strong performance from its food halls and improving trends in its clothing arm, which was struggling before the crisis. The retailer said its international business had also been hit hard by pandemic restrictions, with sales down 10.4%. It also warned that the business was suffering because of Brexit. It faced potential tariffs on some of the products it exports to the EU as well as a very complex administrative process that would “significantly impact” its operations in Ireland, the Czech Republic and France. M&S slumped to a pre-tax loss of £87.6m in the first six months of its financial year after its clothing sales were hit hard by pandemic-related store closures. The chain is an essential retailer but its food halls have not experienced the same sales uplifts as the major supermarkets because many are convenience stores in currently empty city centres and train stations.",theguardian
37,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/07/lawyer-calling-for-dominic-cummings-investigation-forced-to-move-after-attacks-on-home,Exclusive  Lawyer calling for Dominic Cummings investigation forced to move after attacks on home ,"The former regional chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal has revealed he was forced to move house after his campaign for an investigation into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings apparently prompted attacks on his property. In June, a week after Afzal became the figurehead in a legal campaign to prosecute the prime minister’s former chief aide, a brick was thrown through the window of his family home in Manchester, he told the Guardian. The following month his car was “slashed” outside the home after he announced he had urged the Metropolitan police and Crown Prosecution Service to investigate Cummings’ journeys to Durham and Barnard Castle. Afzal said: “My family felt scared. I don’t blame Dominic Cummings. All I know is that in 25 years prosecuting some of the most organised criminals in the country, nobody has attacked my home. Yet suddenly someone starting attacking me and my family and we’ve had to move house. “There’s always a personal cost to standing up [for] what’s right. In 2006 I was on an al-Qaida death list after I prosecuted Danish cartoon protesters, and in 2012 the far right demonstrated outside my house after the Rochdale grooming gang case. I accept that people will attack me personally, but I draw the line when my family is involved.” Afzal said he would not be intimidated. “It has made me more committed to delivering justice, not just in the Cummings case, but for anybody for feels they are not being listened to. More than 3,000 people have crowdfunded the campaign to get Cummings prosecuted, and thousands more have messaged me to say ‘you’re doing this for me’. This is about restoring trust.” Cummings, who resigned from the government in November after an internal power struggle, denies his movements during the first lockdown amounted to a breach of the Covid regulations. In December, Durham police revealed it was assessing a 225-page dossier submitted by Afzal and his lawyers, alleging Cummings breached the lockdown rules multiple times and perverted the course of justice in his account of his movements. Afzal says the documents gave Durham police a “second bite of the cherry” after the force decided to take no further action against Cummings following a three-day investigation in May. “I suspect they are now carrying out a much more thorough investigation than the very cursory one back in May. Durham police now has the opportunity to restore public confidence in them,” he said. “I know for a fact that senior police officers feel it has set back public confidence in policing. And the evidence says that public compliance with the rules has diminished as a result of Cummings’ behaviour.” Afzal, a former senior prosecutor for London and the chief prosecutor for north-west England until 2015, said: “If this was the prosecution service I was part of, I have no doubt they would say there is a case to answer. My concern is that we may not have as robust and courageous a prosecution service as we had in the past.” If Durham police and the CPS decide not to prosecute, Afzal says he would have the financial backing to pursue the case himself. “I could prosecute the perverting the course of justice allegation as a private prosecution. I have been approached by philanthropists who like many are deeply concerned by what happened and are prepared to pay for any legal action that might follow, but it should be the state taking the responsibility.” Afzal said he feels “angry and emboldened” by the events of 2020. His older brother Umar died of coronavirus in April while isolating at home in Birmingham. Weeks later, his mother died of a “broken heart”, he said. He added: “My brother would not be dead if the government hadn’t stopped community testing on 12 March.” Afzal, who is currently suffering from Covid himself, also offered to meet Boris Johnson on behalf of the families bereaved by the virus. “I think he desperately needs to hear the voices of the bereaved. I would bring along others who have suffered similarly. The prime minister would benefit tremendously from hearing from us – he would be more decisive and listen to the scientists and medics more.” If Johnson agreed to a meeting, Afzal says he would volunteer to act as a US-style special prosecutor to investigate the UK’s response to the Covid crisis. Such an investigation would help restore public confidence much quicker than a public inquiry, he said. “It could be 10 years before we get the results of any public inquiry, but we need answers now. I would say to the prime minister: ‘Give me the legal powers and I will be your special prosecutor on the response to Covid. It’s important you do this, prime minister, because public confidence and trust is at an all-time low.’” In April, a paperback version of Afzal’s book The Prosecutor will be published with a new chapter on the death of his brother and the Cummings affair.",theguardian

Staffordshire police confirmed they arrested a 49-year-old and a 42-year-old after receiving a call from one of them, who appeared to have unwittingly sat on his phone. Officers said they listened in to the call as the men carried out the burglary and could even hear their colleagues arrive to make the arrests. “I think we have just arrested the world’s unluckiest burglars,” said Ch Insp John Owen. Police said they arrested the two men in the Middleport area of Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of burglary after receiving the “suspicious call” on Wednesday evening. They were still in custody on Thursday morning. Poking fun at the unlucky pair, Owen included an image of Marv, the hapless burglar from the Home Alone film series, in a Twitter post on Wednesday evening.

It is not the first time a set of robbers has managed to shop themselves with an injudiciously placed rear end. In 2013, a pair who were breaking into a car in Fresno, California, managed to call police on themselves. The call handler on duty was able to track them down as Nathan Teklemariam and Carson Rinehart spent about half an hour discussing their plans. The pair were eventually arrested. “This stuff just doesn’t happen – where a crime is captured from beginning to end,” Sgt Jaime Rios told Today. “The 911 call was still open at the time of the arrests, and the officer took the phone and ended the call himself.” While 25-year-old Callum Tumilty managed not to call the police on himself when he broke into Cambois first school near Blyth, in Northumberland, to steal a load of laptops, his mother was less obliging. Tumilty left his phone behind at the crime scene and was caught after his mother called it to try to track him down and asked the person who answered if Callum was there. Officers on the scene were quickly able to identify and track down the guilty party. According to Newcastle’s Chronicle newspaper, Tumilty was later sentenced to 26 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to several charges.",theguardian

Labour accused the Conservative party of failing to call out Trump once it had become clear weeks ago he was refusing to accept the result of the presidential elections. It also accused senior Tories of years of fawning over a known populist who insulted his allies, peddled conspiracy theories and, by treating authoritarians as his natural allies, undermined democracy everywhere. Labour pointed to interviews in which Boris Johnson said Trump was as worthy of the Nobel peace prize as Barack Obama and described him as a standard New York liberal. In 2018 Johnson said: “I am increasingly admiring of Donald Trump. I have become more and more convinced that there is method in his madness.” Photos of Michael Gove, the now Cabinet Office minister and prominent Brexit campaigner, grinning thumbs-up alongside the president caught the initial mood. But in a tweet on Wednesday night Johnson, described as Britain’s Trump by Trump himself, tweeted: “Disgraceful scenes in U.S. Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be an orderly and peaceful transfer of power.” His remarks, avoiding direct criticism of Trump’s role in inciting the violence, prompted a scathing response from the former shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who tweeted: “That’s it? Not a word of direct criticism of Trump. No condemnation of the incitement. No recognition that this is the culmination of 4 yrs of division, lies and contempt. 4 yrs when our own Britain Trump (as the President called him) has behaved like a shameful sycophant.” That's it? Not a word of direct criticism of Trump. No condemnation of the incitement. No recognition that this is the culmination of 4 yrs of division, lies & contempt. 4 yrs when our own Britain Trump (as the President called him) has behaved like a shameful sycophant #Shameful https://t.co/uW7E6rWcF3 Thornberry spent two years as shadow foreign secretary challenging Johnson over his closeness to Trump, warning him that he was making a strategic error that would ultimately backfire. Soon after the election results started to be dismissed as fraudulent by Trump, Thornberry urged the government to be more direct in its condemnation.  Perhaps stung by the criticism, Johnson finally went further at his Downing Street late afternoon press conference when directly confronted about the issue. He said: “In so far as he encouraged people to storm the Capitol and in so far as the president has consistently cast doubt on the free and fair election, I think that what the president has been saying on that is completely wrong. I unreservedly condemn encouraging people to behave in the disgraceful way as they did in the Capitol.” Until then the clearest denunciation had come from the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said: “America is the world’s biggest, most important democracy, a shining light on the hill for freedom. President Trump told a crowd to march on Capitol Hill & turned on his vice-president for upholding the law. He shames American democracy tonight & causes its friends anguish but he is not America.” Hunt has been joined by other former foreign office ministers who believe Trump needs to be removed from the presidency immediately. The defence select committee chairman, Tobias Ellwood, accused Trump of “undermining democracy, inciting violence, fuelling division & damaging what the nation stands for & believes in. Why say this? He has 2 weeks left & will not go quietly.” Alistair Burt, another former foreign office minister, also called for Trump’s immediate removal from office. By contrast, his successor, James Cleverly, constrained by office, spoke of his distress at the scenes in Washington as if the capital had been hit by a natural disaster. The overall UK government strategy all along has been that it would be suicidal to fall out with Trump, and by influencing those around him, such as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, British interests – including a potential free trade deal – could be protected post-Brexit. In the process, Britain absorbed frequent humiliations, including being ignored on key diplomatic moves such as the withdrawal of US troops from north-east Syria, the US withdrawal from the Iran deal, bullying over Huawei’s role in 5G and public criticism of Theresa May’s Brexit strategy. It was symptomatic of the relationship, and a cause of distress to many in the Foreign Office when Johnson failed to stand by the former British ambassador to Washington Kim Darroch after cables critical of Trump’s personality were leaked. The documents, written in 2017, rightly predicted the Trump administration would not become less dysfunctional, less unpredictable, less faction riven, less diplomatically clumsy and inept. Much of this tolerance was due to Brexiteers seeing Trump’s and their own rise stemming from the same ideological well. Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote in the Times in 2018 ahead of one of Trump’s visits: “It is our national good fortune that the president with whom we will develop this new arrangement is Mr Trump. His election depended upon similar factors to those that led to Brexit. He appealed to voters left behind by the metropolitan elite and he exudes confidence about his own nation and a determination not to be a manager of decline, which also inspires the Brexiteers.” Britain, he said, quoting the former prime minister Harold Macmillan, could play the role of Greeks to the Americans’ Romans.",theguardian

The latest payment follows a £44m payout to the brothers two months ago, and another big payout last spring, and means that in total they have received dividends worth almost £100m during the last 12 months.  Simon Arora, B&M’s chief executive, and his brother Bobby will receive the latest sum as part of a £200m special dividend payment to shareholders. The pair own all the shares in Luxembourg-based SSA Investments, B&M’s biggest single shareholder, with 15% of the company. A third brother, Robin, owns a further 3% of the business and will get £6m. The huge payouts put the Aroras among the best-paid company leaders in Britain. The Sunday Times Rich List estimated their net wealth at £2.1bn last year. B&M, which sells items ranging from frozen foods to plants and homewares, has been one of the most prominent corporate beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic, as locked-down shoppers switched their spending to “essential” retailers that were allowed to remain open. The latest payout is the third dividend payment the retailer has made to shareholders during the last 12 months. In April it paid a £150m dividend after selling and leasing back a Bedford warehouse, while in November it gave shareholders more than £290m. B&M said on Thursday it would award 30,000 workers an extra week’s wages as a bonus. A spokesman declined to detail the exact size of the staff payment. Profits at the company could have been higher, but it last month bowed to public pressure to return £80m in business rates relief granted by the government to help companies through the pandemic. After it became clear that sales at essential retailers had surged, most major retailers belatedly returned the payouts. Other top investors who will receive the dividends included American investment houses Fidelity, Vanguard and Fiduciary Management. The latest payout came as B&M continued its rapid growth. The chain does not sell online, meaning it has missed out on the soaring demand for home delivery of groceries and other retail products. However, it has benefited from the change in spending habits as shoppers eschewed the high street in favour of out-of-town stores to avoid crowds. B&M said like-for-like sales in UK stores surged by 21% in the three months to Boxing Day. Simon Arora said the latest lockdown meant there were uncertainties ahead, but added that he was confident in the retailer’s cheap prices and its focus on out-of-town locations.",theguardian
41,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/merrick-garland-joe-biden-attorney-general,'Restoring integrity'  Biden picks Merrick Garland as attorney general ,"Joe Biden formally selected Merrick Garland to be his attorney general on Thursday, tasking the long-serving jurist with the responsibility of restoring “the honor, the integrity, the independence” of a beleaguered justice department. Speaking a day after a violent mob stormed the US Capitol, the president-elect said Garland, whose 2016 supreme court nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans, would be the “people’s lawyer”, drawing a sharp contrast with Donald Trump, who repeatedly sought to use the department to advance his own personal and political agenda. “You won’t work for me. You are not the president or the vice-president’s lawyer,” Biden said in remarks from Wilmington, Delaware, that started by denouncing the violence that marked “one of the darkest days in the history of our nation”. “Your loyalty is not to me. It’s to the law, to the constitution to the people of this nation.” The president-elect called Garland, a judge on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, “one of the most respected jurists of our time”. He would be, Biden continued, an impartial administrator of justice and not the “personal attorney to the president” and, alongside his other nominees to lead the department, would restore Americans’ faith in the rule of law and seek to build a more equitable system of justice. In his remarks, Garland cited the founding ethos of the department – equal justice under the law – and stressed his commitment to restoring integrity and morale after a tumultuous four years of intense politicization under the Trump administration. “As everyone who watched yesterday’s events in Washington now understands, if they did not understand before, the rule of law is not just some lawyer’s turn of phrase,” Garland said. “It is the very foundation of our democracy. The essence of the rule of law is that like cases are treated alike.” Choosing a judge to fill the role of attorney general is unusual, and perhaps reflects Biden’s shifting political fortunes in recent days. On Tuesday, Democrats won a pair of runoffs in Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate, with Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote. With their slim majority, Democratic senators could overcome any potential opposition by Republicans to his nominee to replace Garland on the DC circuit court. Garland was nominated by Barack Obama to fill the supreme court vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016. In an unprecedented move, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, refused to consider Garland’s nomination, pointing to the proximity of the November presidential election to argue that voters should decide who fills the seat. Nearly five years later, Senate Republicans will have to consider his nomination, albeit for a remarkably different role. Like Obama, Biden is depending on Garland’s reputation as a moderate and affable appellate judge to ensure his confirmation. In his remarks, Biden predicted Garland would be confirmed with bipartisan support based on his conversations with senators. As attorney general, Garland would face weighty decisions over whether to pursue investigations into Trump, former and current members of his administration and his associates that some Democrats are demanding. Biden has made clear he is reluctant to prosecute a former president. In the aftermath of Wednesday’s riots, the US attorney in Washington, Michael Sherwin, said on Thursday that the justice department would not rule out pursuing charges against Trump for his possible role in inciting violence by telling his supporters they could never “take back our country with weakness” and encouraging them to march on the Capitol just before they stormed the building. The justice department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, though Trump’s term ends on 20 January. Trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of pardoning himself in the final days of his presidency, according to a report in the New York Times. During his appearance, Biden refused to comment on growing calls for Trump to be removed from office after the occupation of the US Capitol by rioters loyal to the president. “Our president is not above the law,” Biden, who will be sworn in as president in less than two weeks, said during his remarks on Thursday. Garland may also face questions about how he will handle the tax investigation of Biden’s son Hunter being conducted by the US attorney in Delaware. Republicans, still furious over the department’s special counsel investigation into ties between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, have demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the matter. Democrats roundly praised the nomination of Garland. But Biden, who vowed to assemble the most diverse cabinet in American history, had faced calls from advocates to name a Black or Latino attorney general with a background in civil rights.  Biden on Thursday also named his picks for a slate of other top justice department officials: Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser to Obama, as deputy attorney general; Vanita Gupta, the head of department’s civil rights division under Obama, as the associate attorney general; and Kristen Clarke, a civil rights lawyer, as assistant attorney general for civil rights at the department.",theguardian

Led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the mission involves a solar telescope that will study the way the sun’s atmosphere detaches to become the solar wind. This is a constant sleet of particles that flows through the solar system creating “space weather” that sparks the polar lights on Earth, and disrupts technology. Along with other solar missions, such as the European Space Agency’s Solar Orbiter and Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe, EUVST will help provide a comprehensive investigation into space weather. EUVST will study the sun in precise detail at ultraviolet wavelengths. Also known as Solar-C, it is targeted for launch in the mid-2020s. Japan’s previous solar mission, Hinode or Solar-B, was launched in 2006. Nasa has also announced funding for its Electrojet Zeeman Imaging Explorer (EZIE) mission. Led by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, EZIE will study electrical currents in Earth’s atmosphere to understand more about how the aurora is created by the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth’s magnetic field. Comprising three small “CubeSats”, EZIE will launch sometime after June 2024.",theguardian
43,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/08/best-dance-short-films-to-watch-online,Quick steps  Dynamic dance shorts to watch online ,"Amid lockdown frustration last summer, acclaimed choreographer Cathy Marston had no dance companies to make movement for, so she created some for herself instead and performed for the first time in 15 years. Drift was filmed by the River Aare, near Marston’s home in Switzerland. Balancing on fallen trees or calf-deep in the water, moving meditatively to a specially composed score by regular collaborator Philip Feeney, she offers a welcome retreat from the current world. A powerful telling of the prejudices faced by black ballet dancer Marie-Astrid Mence during her training in her home city of Paris, directed by dancer turned film-maker Rebecca Murray and featured on Nowness. Mence’s gentle voiceover belies the ugliness of her experiences: bullied about her body, told to switch to street dance, made to dance the men’s roles. A dancer with Ballet Black since 2014, Mence proved her detractors wrong, but hers was not an isolated experience and it’s a subject as vital as ever. Just two minutes long but a clever setup: director Daniel McKee uses a large rotating mirror to switch our view between two dancers, Theo Canham-Spence and Florence Pearl, as they move in neat yet somehow languorous choreography by Grace Nicol. First they alternate at leisurely pace, the two dancers like flipsides of a coin, then it accelerates to a cinefilm-style flicker, the dancers merging to the sound of Ben Vince’s saxophone. One from last year you may have missed, a series of collaborations between Welsh poets and dancers, each with a distinct flavour. There’s Faye Tan in closeup detail of eyes, hands and feet, her body listening to the rhythms of Ifor ap Glyn’s words; there’s a highly charged letter written by Marvin Thompson in response to a plaque erected to honour a slave trader; and Hanan Issa trying to remember the Arabic for cardamom as Aisha Naamani looks wistfully out over Cardiff Bay. Determined to shed light on the experiences and talents of dyslexic artists, choreographers Elizabeth Arifien and Charlotte Edmonds founded Move Beyond Words. Their first film, Un[box]ed, takes a literal approach to the idea of being penned in by labels and expectations, with dancer Kirubel Belay – all intense stare and flailing dreadlocks – caught inside a cage-like frame, trying to dance his way out. When you start burrowing into the abundance of dance videos that have appeared online since March, you may think you’re the only person who hasn’t filmed themselves throwing shapes in front of their iPhone. There’s been great enthusiasm for mass video dance projects, from TikTok memes to the 172 people who submitted footage to the Akram Khan Company for Our Animal Kingdom. Dancers of any age, nationality and experience were invited to contribute movement inspired by the natural world, which has been expertly wrangled by film-maker Maxime Dos to make a great global coming-together.",theguardian

47,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/rightwing-media-reaction-trump-mob-capitol,Denial and conspiracies  How rightwing media reacted to the storming of the US Capitol ,"Many institutions were brought to a crisis point by Wednesday’s pro-Trump riot in Washington. One of them was conservative media. If the bond between Donald Trump and his supporters has been a shared, paranoid hostility towards governing institutions, as well as the media and the left, this mindset has been promoted and nurtured by conservative media over decades. As long as Trump was riding high, conservative media were often happy to excuse the violence, too. But with Trump on his way out, seemingly cut loose by Republican elites and his own staff, would his one-time media allies excuse the insurrectionary mob that trashed the Capitol in the president’s name? The last 24 hours has seen various responses - few honest, fewer honorable – to this dilemma. Some outlets simply refused to acknowledge that Trump or the rioters have done anything wrong, even at the cost of self-contradiction. In Gateway Pundit – one of the more florid purveyors of ride-or-die Trumpism – Cassandra Fairbanks initially described the Capitol Hill rioters as “patriots”. When the optics took a turn for the worse, and even Trump himself urged adherence to the law, their writer Christine Lalla pivoted to a conspiracy theory evoking a reliable rightwing folk devil: busloads of antifa. On Twitter, Christina Bobb, an anchor on pro-Trump cable news channel OANN, depicted the riot as presenting an opportunity for Mike Pence, the vice-president, to overturn the election. OANN and other networks have followed Trump’s lead in promoting the false idea that Pence, as Senate president, can selectively reject votes from the electoral college. Notwithstanding that Pence’s role is, in fact, ceremonial, Cassandra Fairbanks again joined Bobb and others in the delusion that Pence had failed in his duty, and was in fact a traitor. Things are trickier for those not content to go down with the Trumpist ship, and who must tack into shifting political winds. With Trump gone, but his supporters still a significant and lucrative component of the conservative media audience, many outlets relied on flattering Trump’s supporters, even as they continued their slow, careful abandonment of Trump himself. On Fox News, Tucker Carlson opened his Wednesday night show with a monologue that empathized with rioters even as he blamed their actions on others. Carlson did offer a very general condemnation of political violence and, apropos of nothing, discouraged the idea of a Balkanization of the country into like-minded communities. But he then attributed the mob’s actions to those who would not give their conspiracy theories about election theft a proper hearing. Carlson pointed to the dangers that might arise “if people come to believe that their democracy is fraudulent”. Without discussing conservative media’s central role in promoting post-election conspiracy narratives, he argued that “millions of Americans sincerely believe that the last election was fake. You can dismiss them as crazy. You can call them conspiracy theorists. You can kick them off Twitter. But that won’t change their minds.” Others tried the same trick in print. Filing from the scene, the Federalist’s Emily Jashinsky admitted the riot was a “disgraceful sight” and dismissed the conspiracy-minded idea that antifa provocateurs were responsible. She laid blame on Trump for inciting them, writing: “He told them a ‘landslide’ win was being stolen. That would be a crisis. They acted as such. What did he expect?” But she then moved to coddle his coalition, arguing that the riot “will hurt the people who were already hurting most”, mentioning the “decent” Americans who “have been lied to by the media for years … smeared as racists by elites and peers alike”. There was no mention – in her article or in any of the other lachrymose evocations of Trump’s forgotten people – that political scientists have repeatedly shown that racial resentment and hostile sexism are the strongest motivations for supporting Trump. Further out on far-right media, there was an effort to transform Ashli Babbitt, a woman who was shot dead by Capitol police, into a political martyr. On Alex Jones’ Infowars website, Babbitt was described as a “patriot” and her death as an “execution”. Along with other extremist sites, Infowars offered graphic footage and images of Babbitt’s death. The political line that many on the far right took into the events of the Capitol has only been bolstered by Babbitt’s death. Infowars and its conspiracy theorist proprietor can look forward to presenting themselves as the principal resistance to the Biden administration, while wielding Babbitt as a symbol of defiance. Elsewhere, there were signs of despair in the wake of the events at the Capitol, and the congressional confirmation of the election result. On rightwing Catholic site Church Militant, David Gordon asked “Why did God allow Biden-Harris to prevail?”, averring that “the specter of an impending Joe Biden presidency is haunting America’s Christian faithful”. For a small minority of commentators, the events elicited self-reflection. On that score, it would be difficult to better Kevin D Williamson’s summary of conservative media’s crooked, craven path through the Trump era in a Thursday article on National Review Online. He writes: The Trump presidency began in shame and dishonesty. It ends in shame, dishonesty, cowardice and rebellion against the constitution. For the past few weeks, the rightwing media, including the big talk-radio shows, has been coyly calling for a revolution. Of course they never thought they’d actually get one: that kind of talk is good for business – keep the rubes riled up and they won’t change the channel when the commercials come around on the half-hour.” We can expect this kind of insight to remain atypical in conservative media over the coming years: those who are not girding their loins for a pitched battle with America’s incoming government are warily hedging their bets.",theguardian
48,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jan/07/indian-fashion-designer-satya-paul-an-artist-dies-aged-79,Satya Paul  Indian designer who revolutionised the sari dies aged 79 ,"Satya Paul, the Indian fashion designer who invented the modern sari, has died at the age of 79. His son, Puneet Nanda, said in a Facebook post that the designer had suffered a stroke in early December from which he had not recovered. Paul revolutionised the idea of the sari for Indian women, moving it beyond a utilitarian ethos. He used experimental touches like geometric patterns, and unexpected fabrics such as muga and tussar silks, chiffon and crepe, to revitalise the silhouette. Paul also pioneered the “trouser sari” – a touchstone of modern sartorial independence for Indian women and a sharp U-turn away from the traditional Banarasi sari. “I always thought of him as an artist,” designer Kaushik Velendra told the Guardian. “He worked with his colours like a painter.” Paul was born in 1942 in Layyah, in what is now Pakistan, before his family moved to India. “My family was uprooted from Pakistan and landed in India with nothing in hand,” he told DNA India magazine. He began his career in retail, before moving into the niche market of Indian heirlooms which he exported to Europe and the US. With no formal design training, he launched his first sari boutique, L’Affaire, in 1980. “I had to self-teach myself about design and quality, as I was not content only with trading,” he told DNA India. In 1986 he started his eponymous label. Worn by Indian celebrities such as Aishwarya Rai, Mandira Bedi, Karisma Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor and Vidya Balan, it became one of the best known fashion brands in the country. “Design is like a river for me,” he told DNA India. “It is continuously on.” The label diversified into other products including ties – which became as well-known as its saris – and dresses, handbags, scarves and kaftans.   At its heart the Satya Paul brand was about “making people feel better about themselves by wearing his clothes. It’s the best way he represented what India stands for,” said Velendra. Paul and his son Nanda, whom he partnered with, exited the company in 2010. Designer Osman Yousefzada told the Guardian: “Growing up in Birmingham in the 90s, there was [a] sari emporium on Stratford Road which was a mecca of saris. It sold Satya Paul and the well-heeled immigrants would go and try on his beautiful fabrics in their new, grey homeland. His use of colour and fabrics has always inspired me.” Posting on Instagram, designer Masaba Gupta highlighted the importance of Paul’s legacy, writing that the designer was “a true example of an actual (homegrown) brand: put in corporate hands at the right time and one with a signature that will stand the test of time. Fashion schools – please introduce young Indian design aspirants to this brand in schools and various other homegrown brands. We can be inspired by the story of Chanel … but we must learn what happened on our soil first.” Velendra said Paul had changed fashion in India by putting his stamp on to everything he designed, no matter how big or small. “[Paul’s] personal involvement in everything has created a benchmark that a lot of other designers have followed,” he said. “Even if it was commercial, even if it was extravagant, it was personal. In that context, he created an example of how we should all work. That’s something that will never be forgotten.”",theguardian
49,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/07/barbara-blake-hannah-how-britains-first-black-female-tv-reporter-was-forced-off-our-screens,Barbara Blake-Hannah  How Britain’s first black female TV reporter was forced off our screens ,"In 2008, Barbara Blake-Hannah sat down to write a letter of admonishment to the Guardian. “I must put history right,” she wrote, explaining that a poster issued by the paper was incorrect. It contained, she noted, the common misconception that Trevor McDonald was the first Black person to report the news on British TV after he joined ITN in 1973 and that Moira Stuart, on BBC News from 1981, was the first Black woman. In fact, said Blake-Hannah – an author, film-maker and former Jamaican senator – in 1968 she was one of three Thames Television on-camera reporters for the current affairs programme Today, presented by Eamonn Andrews. (The BBC had hired a Black trainee reporter, Eric Anthony Abrahams, a few years earlier.) At the time her appointment made every daily newspaper, bar the Daily Express. Blake-Hannah claims the Express held out only because “they had a rule: no Black people on the front page”. “Shirley Bassey sang regularly and there were comedians, but we were allowed in an entertainment capacity, not as serious news people, delivering serious stories.” She reported five days a week, on everything from the closing-down sale of the Beatles’ Baker Street shop (“They gave away everything in the store, so you can imagine the riot”) to gang crime in the East End of London. But, after nine months, the producers told her abruptly that they would not be renewing her contract. Why? Because of the numerous calls and letters from viewers objecting to a Black person on TV. “It broke my heart,’” she says. Blake-Hannah is speaking to me from her home in Kingston, Jamaica, where she settled in 1972. She embraced Rastafari; the straightened, Vidal Sassoon-style bob of her 60s TV appearances has long been replaced by a leopard-print headwrap. Her only child, Makonnen Hannah, is nearby – he made headlines globally in 1998 when, as a 13-year-old, he was appointed the youngest-ever adviser to Jamaica’s Ministry of Commerce and Technology. Blake-Hannah was raised in an affluent part of the Jamaican capital by her father, Evon Blake, a prominent magazine editor. His work meant mixing with the great and the good, but she says he is best remembered as the man who desegregated the swimming pool of the affluent Myrtle Bank hotel, a favourite haunt of one of his employees. “This accountant would go and swim there every midday, but my father, his boss, couldn’t. So one day my father put on his swimsuit and dived in. The horror! The manager came and said: ‘Mr Blake, you have to get out of the pool.’ He said: ‘No. Call the manager, call the prime minister, call God!’ And that was it: he liberated that pool, and he liberated Jamaican tourism.” It was never about the pool. The family had access to a pool and Blake-Hannah and her sister swam every morning. They were attended to by a cook, a gardener and a nursemaid and had places at the prestigious boarding school Hampton, alongside the daughters of the Caribbean elite. “There were 100 girls, only 10 of whom were Black, of whom my sister and I were the ‘blackest’,” she says. The young Blake-Hannah’s expensive education ended prematurely, however, just after her O-levels. “By then, my father’s finances had collapsed. He took me out and put me in secretarial school. I wept bitter tears, but it really turned out to be most useful.” By the time Blake-Hannah accepted a job offer in Britain – a bit-part in the 1965 film A High Wind in Jamaica, starring Anthony Quinn – her work experience already included journalism, copywriting for an advertising agency, hosting a TV quizshow, appearing in a pantomime and a spot of modelling. It was a good life, but she felt drawn to the “mother country”. “I’d been educated to be a Black Englishwoman. I could tell you the average rain rate for all of the Lake District and recite Wordsworth’s poem to daffodils. I spoke and wrote perfect English and I thought: ‘Well, apart from the disadvantage of brown skin, kinky hair and a broad nose, I would be quite OK, y’know?’” Britain did not offer the warm Commonwealth welcome she had hoped for. “The contempt was so visible all the time; that was a real shock,” she says. A shock, but hardly a surprise. “Slavery already taught us that, y’know? The white man will have contempt: you are his inferior and he doesn’t have to like you. So you’re kind of prepared. Or, at that time in the development of Black people in the world, that was our attitude.” Thames [TV] had a good opportunity to act on the Race Relations Act and they didn’t. They decided to continue the racism The practical difficulties, however, were a shock. “Trying to get accommodation is really where it hit home,” she says. “No one would rent you anywhere decent. You had to be prepared to have the worst accommodation, in the worst parts of town.” In the end, she could find only a room in a house where she had to share the single bathroom with two families from India. “It was really awful to have to put up with life under those conditions,” she says. Work was easier to come by, although she had to start at the bottom. After a succession of temporary secretarial jobs, Blake-Hannah got a position at the PR company employed in the UK by Jamaica. In time, she began writing for the Sunday Times and felt herself embraced by a community, alongside the expat West Indian one. “I had a very good girlfriend – Celia Brayfield, who became a bestselling author – and we’d go to the parties that the Sunday Times and other journalists would give,” she says. Was she the only person of colour within that media circle? Probably, but the thought never occurred to her. “It was an artistic community; that was colourless, y’know? It didn’t matter. The Beatles had just gone to India, good heavens! So everybody was dressing in Indian clothes. It was a multicultural melting pot.” It offered respite from discrimination elsewhere. “You were aware of racism at all times. I think it was just this circle of people who had no hang-ups, no prejudices, that made life not too difficult.” By the mid-60s, the Black liberation movement was well under way, yet somehow it felt far removed from Blake-Hannah’s life in London. “The revolution was something that was happening in America,” she says. “‘Black is beautiful’, Black power, Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael; our Black brains started ticking over because of them, but the Black community on Ladbroke Grove was a place you tried your best to get away from, because you knew it was really the bottom and you weren’t accustomed to that; I certainly wasn’t.” It would take several more years – and a Rastafari awakening – before Blake-Hannah began to consider her place in this revolution. She moved in different circles to the activists such as the Mangrove nine, who were arrested for protesting against police harassment of the Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill and then fought a landmark legal battle to highlight racism in the criminal justice system. “People asked me the other day if I was part of the Mangrove uprising. Mangrove was happening at the same time as I had my PR job. I took people to lunch, y’know, at restaurants on Kings Road. I didn’t take clients to lunch at the Mangrove.” When conducting interviews in public, she was shielded from much of the prejudice, if only because most people were flattered by the presence of a camera. “I put that down to the fact that people like to be on television. It doesn’t matter who’s asking them the questions,” she says. But being a journalist couldn’t protect her from racism within the media. “I remember a job in Birmingham; they asked me one morning: ‘Well, Barbara, if Black people are so great, how come they didn’t paint the Mona Lisa?’” She was speechless. “I didn’t have an answer. I didn’t know there was anything to compare to the Mona Lisa. I thought that Egypt was Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra, y’know? I didn’t know anything about Africa. Except that we had come from there as slaves. That’s all I knew.” One day in 1968, she was sent to report at the Houses of Parliament. “I remember being on a bus and passing by South Africa House in Trafalgar Square and white people using the N-word and shouting up at my face in the bus: ‘Go back home.’ This was the year of the bill proposing amendments to the Race Relations Act 1965, making it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services on the grounds of race. In March, Enoch Powell had delivered his infamous “Rivers of Blood” speech in objection to the bill. For Blake-Hannah, the timing of her dismissal from Today that year is significant. “Thames Television had a good opportunity to act on the Race Relations Act and they didn’t. They decided to continue the racism. I didn’t know it at the time – I couldn’t say anything – but, looking at it now, it was really wrong. They could easily have said [of the racist complaints]: ‘We don’t care.’” After being let go in such a manner, she says: “I realised there was no space for me in Britain.” She did find another job in TV, at Associated Television in Birmingham, but unrelenting racism interfered again with her work. No accommodation near her new job would accept a Black tenant, so she was forced to undertake an exhausting daily commute from London. In her 2008 letter to the Guardian, she recalled how she had to “listen without reacting when the production staff asked: ‘What ‘wog’ story are we doing today?’” On another occasion, she wrote, Powell agreed to do an interview with the station “on condition that ‘the Black girl’ was not there”. A few years later, she was asked to do PR for the Jamaican film The Harder They Come. She decided to leave the UK. “The entire population of Jamaica tried to get into the cinema that premiere night. When the show was over, the best party I’ve ever been to in my life was held by the Jamaicans. I couldn’t wait to get back home … I did not look back.” What she did on her return was enough to fill many books – and illustrates just how much Britain lost. She produced several films, including the 1982 Channel 4 documentary Race, Rhetoric, Rastafari, and several books, including a 2010 memoir covering her time in Britain and an influential manual on home schooling. In 1984, she was elected as an independent senator, becoming the first Rastafarian to serve in the Jamaican parliament. She has always kept abreast of British news and now campaigns against what she calls “heartless” Home Office deportations to Jamaica – which Priti Patel, the home secretary, last week promised to make a “regular drumbeat” of British life. Blake-Hannah tells the story of Treymane Brown, a 25-year-old who left Jamaica for the UK as a six-year-old and was separated from his own six-year-old son when he was deported in 2017. While homeless in Jamaica, Brown saved a young boy from drowning in a gully. “All they could do was give him a hero’s award. He still has no job, no money and nowhere to live. None of them do. None of them have any connection with Jamaica except their genes.” In 1984, she was elected as an independent senator, becoming the first Rastafarian to serve in the Jamaican parliament What shocks her most, however, is how little the British media have changed in the 50 years since she was sacked, lest the shade of her skin offend racists. “When Meghan [the Duchess of Sussex] was still in Britain, you’d see a story and go into the comments section … I could see into the minds of the people who would call in [to Today] and say: ‘Get that N-word off our screens!’ Those people still exist in Britain today.” Whether it is supermarkets’ TV adverts, Black Lives Matter-themed dance performances or breakfast news presenters being disciplined, it often seems the racists in the audience complain louder and have their feelings considered more than the non-racist majority. “You know why? British people have never been taught the full story of their history … the Queen of England is a nice old lady, nuff respect, but when I see Colston’s statue toppled and I read the history of the Royal African Company … You all need to know your history! That will stop the arrogance and that will stop the racism.” Her own place in that history is being reclaimed. This year, the annual British Journalism awards awarded the inaugural Barbara Blake-Hannah prize to the Independent’s Kuba Shand-Baptiste. The award for up-and-coming minority ethnic journalist also had the coolest prize – to fly out to Jamaica to meet Blake-Hannah. She is also part of Britain’s Black History Month curriculum and has received various lifetime achievement awards and an Order of Distinction from the Jamaican government. But the journalism award is, she says, particularly meaningful: “Every year, I will be remembered by all these beautiful Black, brown, Asian journalists. I am so honoured.” The advice she has for the recipients is the same as that for all who follow in her footsteps: “Learn your history. Don’t be like Barbara Blake when they said: ‘If Black people are so great, how come they never painted the Mona Lisa?’ Have an answer, because somebody’s gonna ask you. And then teach them something. Come into work one morning and say: ‘Hey, do you know that it’s Usain Bolt’s birthday today?’ Just once in a while, say something Black.”",theguardian
50,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jan/06/diego-maradona-1986-world-cup-mexico-david-yarrow-best-photograph,David Yarrow's best photograph  Maradona lifts the World Cup ,"On the final day of exams at Edinburgh University in the summer of 1986, most students partied, but I flew directly to Mexico City. I was 20 years old and studying business and economics while taking photos on the side. I’d never been to the Americas before, and I wasn’t at all a good photographer; in fact, I was incredibly average. I arrived at the 1986 World Cup under the guise of being a freelance photojournalist, but I was a Scotland fan first and foremost – they always used to say that Scottish journalists are just fans with typewriters. I did have a press pass that I’d managed to blag off the Times, which granted me access to the media pen, but I was much more interested in watching football than taking photographs of it. There was a moment in the first round of a match with Uruguay when Scotland missed an open goal. Back at the Times they were watching the TV coverage of the game and could see the striker with his head in his hands, and in the background me with my head in my hands and with my camera nowhere near the moment. And they thought: “Well this guy, Yarrow, he’s not focused on the task at all.” These were the days in sports photography before auto-focus, meaning that to capture a moving figure clearly, you had to do a thing called follow focus. Essentially, you moved a ring on the camera in unison with the movement of the players. So if you had a 100-metre sprinter coming toward you, you would try to get as many different pictures of them in focus as possible. It’s a real skill and not one I was good at, which meant that the only decent pictures I got at the tournament were of the players lining up at the beginnings of matches. I got to the stadium at six in the morning – even though the match was at midday Fifa had a rule though that every country that qualified for the tournament would be allowed one photographer on the pitch for the final. Scotland had been the first team to get knocked out. This tends to happen habitually, so all the photographers on expense bills for the newspapers were sent home along with the Scotland team. It left me, as a 20-year-old, with a press pass for the pitch of the World Cup final. I remember going to the stadium at six o’clock in the morning, although the game was at midday. I bribed a Mexican guard with a bit of whisky and said: “Do you mind if I walk on to the pitch?” In those days, the Azteca stadium held around 120,000 people. He allowed me to walk from one goal to the other, and I could see my footprints in the dew on the grass. It was a bit of an epiphany. There’s that Mark Twain saying: “The two most important days in your life are the day your born and the day you find out why.” On the pitch I thought: “Well, I’m doing this at 20; photography has surely got to be a big part of my life?” But this experience didn’t change the fact that I was still a fairly rubbish photographer, but I got lucky. I was in the right position for the first Argentinian goal in the final, and when Argentina won the most extraordinary thing happened. Probably about 20 to 30,000 Argentinians ran on to the pitch. It was just a scrum. I had two lenses and two cameras, like most football photographers in those days. The long lens was for covering the midfield area, and the wide-angle lens for the goalmouth areas. I thought: “If I take my wide-angle and get as close to Maradona as possible, I might get a picture.” But to be nimble, I would have to leave my long lens in the goalmouth. It was a split-second decision, but I figured that if I lost the equipment, as long as I’ve gotten close to Diego Maradona it’s the right call. As it turned out, I got dead close to him, square on to him, just as he was lifted on to another player’s shoulders. It was like a biblical scene, with the thousands of people behind him. Maradona looked right in my eyes while holding up the World Cup. Those were the days of film, so you didn’t know if you’d gotten the shot – you didn’t know whether you’d captured it sharp or got the lighting right. I wouldn’t find out until later just how well the photo had come out, but I did return to the goalmouth to find, to my surprise, the $7,000 lens and camera still sitting there among the thousands of people. I remember that day as if it were yesterday, and I was so fortunate to have my moment in the chaos. Maradona looked magnificent riding high on Argentinian shoulders, but little did I know back then that my photograph would stand the test of time. Maradona was a genius, and I owe him so much.

Matthew Mason admitted bludgeoning 15-year-old Alex Rodda to death with a wrench in woods in Cheshire on 12 December 2019. The court heard they had been involved in a brief sexual relationship before Rodda told Mason’s girlfriend that the older teenager had sent him explicit photos and a video. Mason argued at trial that he had experienced a loss of control during the killing and had been blackmailed by Rodda, who he claimed had tried to attack him before his death. He was found guilty of murder by a majority of jurors at Chester crown court on Thursday. He will be sentenced at a later date. In a statement, Rodda’s family described the 15-year-old as a “wonderful, gentle, loving, kind, caring, respectful boy who loved life and lived life to the full”. “His precious life was cut short all too soon at the hands of Matthew Mason,” they said. The family said they had never come across a more “selfish, cold and calculating person” than Mason, who they said had “attempted to blame Alex and discredit his name throughout this trial, and thankfully the jury were able to see through his web of deceit”. Mason, an architectural engineering student, wept in the dock as the guilty verdict was returned. He previously told jurors he had asked friends and family for money to pay Rodda but did not tell them what it was for. He said he was embarrassed and worried after having sex with the younger boy, adding that he thought it was wrong “because he was a male and, secondly, his age”. The trial heard Rodda had contacted Mason’s then girlfriend and told her he had been sending “flirty” messages and an explicit picture and video. Mason denied the allegations to his girlfriend but began making payments to Rodda’s bank account at around the same time, amounting to more than £2,200 by the time of Rodda’s death. The court heard Mason had searched the internet for phrases including “what would happen if you kicked someone down the stairs” and “everyday poison”. He said he was looking for ways to kill himself as he felt depressed and suicidal following the end of his relationship with his girlfriend. The court heard that Mason picked the younger boy up from his home in Tabley, Cheshire, and drove him to a remote spot on the night of the murder. Mason, who lived on his family’s farm near Knutsford, Cheshire, said he told Rodda that he could not afford to give him any more money. He said he had taken a wrench with him because he felt intimidated by the teenager and wanted to scare him. Mason claimed that Rodda had grabbed the wrench from him and pushed him to the floor. Evidence showed that Rodda had been struck at least 15 times in what was described by the prosecution as a brutal attack.",theguardian

The video claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party is anti-farmers while Congress works towards their betterment. He said Congress will fight with the farmers to get the three contentious farm laws repealed. The Congress party has time and again slammed the Union government over the farm laws. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi met with President Ram Nath Kovind to discuss the laws and the issues faced by protesting farmers. Farmers to meet the government today The eighth round of talks between protesting farmer unions and the government is scheduled to be held on Friday afternoon as both sides look for a resolution to the over one-month-long deadlock on the issue of the three new farm laws. Both sides have stuck to their respective positions, with agitating farmers taking out tractor rallies on Thursday to press their demand for rollback of the laws, and the Centre asserting it is ready to consider any proposal other than their repeal. The latest round of talks to be held at Vigyan Bhavan at 2 pm on Friday is crucial as the previous meeting on January 4 remained inconclusive. There was some breakthrough in the sixth round of talks on December 30 when the government conceded to two demands of the agitating farmers pertaining to power subsidy and stubble burning. The previous rounds of talks had failed to make any headway. Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary said that as per the farmers' initial demand, the government is ready to amend the laws. To help find a solution, the farmers will also have to understand the government's perspective. ""I'm hopeful that a solution to farmers' issue could be found through dialogue. When we'll talk clause by clause then we'll surely arrive at a solution. During initial talks, the leaders of farmer unions said they want amendments in the acts and government is ready for that. We'll definitely address all doubts of farmers,"" said the minister. He hoped that in today's meeting the farmers will try to understand the government's perspective. ""The crores of farmers who are supporting these laws are also farmers. We have understood their point (of protesting farmers') and taken 10 steps forward if they also understand the government's perspective and take few steps forward then we will definitely find a solution,"" he added. Farmers are protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

The eighth round of talks between three Union ministers -- Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash -- and the 40 protesting farmer unions to end the farmers' agitation is scheduled to begin at the Vigyan Bhawan here at 2 pm. Just before the talks, Tomar met Home Minister Amit Shah to discuss the issue. Talking to news agency PTI, Choudhury said, ""I am hopeful that a resolution will be reached at Friday's meeting. We could have ended the deadlock by now had the protesting farmer unions discussed the issues raised at the first meeting."" There was no demand for a repeal of the three farm laws at the first meeting, he added. Asserting that the new laws enacted by the Centre are in the interest of farmers, Choudhury said the legislations are just a beginning and added that the unions are agitating against the laws under the ""influence of arhtiyas (commission agents)"". ""Next, the Pesticide (Management) Bill and the Seed Bill will come. At that time too, farmers can be misguided,"" he said. Asked if the Centre would encourage religious leaders from Punjab to mediate between the government and the protesting farmers, Choudhury said, ""We welcome everyone. We want a resolution. If they are ready to talk in that direction, we welcome them."" Punjab's Nanaksar Gurdwara head Baba Lakha, a renowned religious leader of the state, met Tomar on Thursday and wished to mediate between the Centre and the protesting farmers.

The top court, in its December 8 verdict, however, dismissed the appeal of land owners against the acquisition of their land for the project. The apex court's verdict had come on a batch of appeals filed by the Centre and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and few land owners and others including PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss. These pleas were filed against the Madras High Court's judgement, delivered on April 8, 2019, holding as “illegal and bad in law"" the notifications issued under Section 3A(1) of the National Highways Act for acquisition of specified lands for construction of the new highway which was part of the larger 'Bharatmala Pariyojna – Phase I5' project. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari had partly allowed the appeals of the Centre and the NHAI to the extent of quashing of the notification to acquire land for the highway project by the Madras High Court and gave its nod to again proceed with the process. “The impugned judgment and order is modified. The challenge to impugned notifications under Sections 2(2) and 3A of the 1956 Act, respectively, is negative. The Central Government and/or NHAI may proceed further in the matter in accordance with law for acquisition of notified lands for construction of a national highway for the proposed section/stretch,"" the judgement had said. The ambitious 277.3-km-long eight-lane greenfield project aims to cut travel time between the two cities Chennai and Salem by half to about two hours and 15 minutes. However, it has been facing opposition from a section of locals, including farmers, over fears of losing their land, besides environmentalists who are against felling trees for it. The project runs through reserve forest and water bodies. Earlier, the high court's order had come on a batch of petitions filed by 35 land owners and PMK leader Ramadoss. They had challenged the land acquisition proceedings. The high court had made clear that grant of prior environmental clearance would undoubtedly require a thorough study of the area and before that, a public hearing was needed to be conducted. It had also held as ""unsatisfactory"" the project report of a consultant and said it needed to be scrapped. It had said unless a proper study was made, the impact on the forest lands, water bodies, wildlife, flora and fauna cannot be assessed.",themint

Bonuses for some JPMorgan Chase & Co. traders are expected to rise, according to a person familiar with the situation, but not as much as the 39% increase in trading revenues at the New York-based bank in the first nine months of 2020. Morgan Stanley has said it would pay $1,000 bonuses to most employees making less than $150,000, but hasn’t given any guidance on payouts for higher-earning staff. Also read Virus spread slows but two states still a worry “It’s a bad year to have a good year,"" said Gilbert Swann, a recruiter at Sheffield Haworth in London whose clients include global investment banks. “It’s not a year that people are going to get paid significantly up, so flat might be the new up."" Payouts to bankers and traders are especially contentious this bonus season. Millions lost their jobs as economies were closed and businesses were bankrupted in the coronavirus pandemic. But the banking sector has largely withstood the crisis thanks to trillions of dollars of funding and support for borrowers from governments and central banks. Investment bank revenue surged as trading increased in volatile markets and companies raised fresh debt and equity. Now, traders and bankers expect to be rewarded for their efforts. That is creating a dilemma for chief executives and boards who worry about how their companies are perceived by politicians, regulators and the taxpayers who will be paying for the crisis for years to come. Even the best performers may find their bonuses curtailed because of this public-perception problem. “Executives are rightly super-concerned about the optics,"" said Nick Miller, a partner at London-based recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson whose clients include global banks. “They’re very wary of the fine line between keeping staff motivated and respecting the broader picture of what it looks like to be paying bonuses."" Over the course of the coronavirus crisis, banks have emphasized their role in channeling emergency credit to companies and letting households delay paying back loans. Those with investment banks benefited, though, from an “everything rally"" last year in stocks, bonds and other assets that was fueled by central bank and government stimulus. Global investment banking revenue rose 25% to $188.2 billion in 2020 compared with the previous year, according to a forecast from Coalition Greenwich, benefiting lenders such as JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Wall Street got a lot of support from the Federal Reserve when the pandemic hit,"" said Tim Schlittner, spokesman for AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation. “We should focus on getting money to Main Street."" According to New York-based compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates, banking industry bonuses are likely to be flat overall compared with 2019 but with wide variations, with lower payouts in retail banking and higher payouts for equity and debt traders, salespeople and underwriters, and “unusual scrutiny"" of pay for chief executive officers. “Investment bankers on average are going to get paid more,"" said Alan Johnson, head of the consulting firm. “It’s uncomfortable in the middle of a pandemic. Some of these people are not beloved to begin with and then we’re going to have stories about people going out and buying fancy cars, and fancy apartments, and that’s going to make a lot of people angry."" In Europe, regulators in London and Frankfurt restricted bonuses and dividend payments in 2020 to make lenders conserve capital in the worsening pandemic. They eased the restrictions in December but told banks to be prudent and moderate on bonuses. Banks will be alert to any backlash from politicians or customers, in a year when the gap between the rich and poor has widened, Carlo Kostka, a lawyer at Covington & Burling LLP, said. “The Covid crisis has created massive inequalities, and everyone has to ask themselves at the end of the day if bonuses beyond a certain limit exacerbate that issue,"" Mr. Kostka said.",themint

""A negative test is not foolproof, but a positive test - they're not coming,"" Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly told reporters in the capital, Canberra. Morrison justified the Brisbane lockdown, given the danger that the new variant could quickly become the dominant strain of the virus. ""I know they will be some in Brisbane today asking 'why is this necessary? There is only one case'. Well, this isn’t any ordinary case. This is a very special case and one that requires us to treat things quite differently,"" Morrison told reporters.

More than 35,000 Australians have registered their intention to return but Morrison said the number allowed back would be reduced by nearly half until mid-February, given the danger of the new variant.
