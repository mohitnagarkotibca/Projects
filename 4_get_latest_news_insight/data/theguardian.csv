But no single tweet has had the same meteor-like impact as the one sent by the president shortly before 1am on Friday morning. It felt like a season finale moment. “Overnight, @FlOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19,” Trump wrote. He added, in matter-of-fact style: “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”. The announcement was astonishing. And yet – seen through the timeline of Trump’s recent activities – it appears wholly unremarkable and perhaps even cosmically inevitable. In recent days the president has behaved with the same reckless disregard for public health rules that has characterised his response since January to the global coronavirus pandemic. Viewed with hindsight, his meetings during the last week look ill-judged, to say the least. On Saturday the president appeared in the Rose Garden to announce his choice for the supreme court nomination, Amy Coney Barrett. Trump appeared on stage with Barrett and her family. Around 200 people watched. One person at the ceremony was Republican senator Mike Lee of Utah. Another was the president of University of Notre Dame, John Jenkins. Jenkins sat without a mask. Lee had a mask but held it loosely in his hand as he got up afterwards and hugged friends. Both men subsequently tested positive for the virus, in what now looks to be a super-spreader event. On Monday, Trump came back to the Rose Garden. He announced new measures to distribute Covid-19 test kits to US states – to defeat what he referred to as the “China virus”. The president was upbeat. He confidently predicted the pandemic would soon be over. “We’re rounding the corner,” he declared. His audience was made up of members of Congress and state officials. Few wore masks. Neither did Trump or the vice-president Mike Pence, who followed the president to the podium. Other administration officials who were present included the health secretary, Alex M Azar, and the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Earlier, Trump inspected a truck on the south lawn and met manufacturers from Ohio. On Tuesday, Trump was preparing for his first televised debate with Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger. These practice sessions took place in the West Wing of the White House. As the Washington press corps has frequently noted, masks are rarely seen inside the White House building. It was almost as if this area of executive power had been deemed off limits to the virus – a fantasy that would soon prove to be spectacularly wrong. Later on Tuesday, Trump boarded Air Force One en route to the debate in Ohio. With him was a large entourage. It included members of the Trump family: his wife Melania, adult children and senior staff. Also there was his trusted aide, 31-year-old Hope Hicks. Since joining his campaign in early 2015, Hicks was often at Trump’s side. She returned to his administration in spring, following an earlier spell as press secretary. None of the entourage were seen wearing masks while getting off the plane. Hicks was spotted climbing into a staff van together with Bill Stepien, the president’s campaign manager, the New York Times reported. Those onboard included the campaign strategist Jason Miller, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and policy adviser Stephen Miller. Inside the debate hall, the two candidates were placed some distance apart. It was a rancorous and horrible night, memorable for Trump talking over his rival. One moment now stands out. Onstage in Cleveland, Trump mocked Biden for his habit of wearing a mask in public. “I think masks are OK,” Trump said. He pointed out that both candidates had been tested for the virus, just before their TV clash, adding: “I put a mask on when I think I need it.” And then Trump went on the attack. Speaking to Biden directly, Trump suggested his rival’s precautions were over the top. And ridiculous: “I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200ft away from them and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” To emphasis his point, Trump spread his arms. Biden, who was in close proximity to Trump for 90 minutes, received a negative Covid test result on Friday afternoon. Trump’s family watched from the audience. None wore masks. This show of support for the president was – it seemed - transgressive. And in clear breach of host rules, which called for blue surgical masks to be worn. A Cleveland clinic doctor in a white lab coat had even tried to approach Trump family guests, offering a mask. She was unsuccessful. Someone shook their head at her as she came close, according to a press pool report. On the flight back to Washington DC, Jared Kushner chatted with colleagues, again maskless; on the tarmac Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump shared an umbrella with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr’s girlfriend. But it was Wednesday that turned out to be the most consequential moment of the 2020 US election. Trump carried on with his campaign activities. There was a fundraiser at the home of a private donor in Minneapolis – and then a rally in Duluth. Everything was as normal: warm-up music for the closely packed crowds waiting for the president, followed by the theatrical arrival of Air Force One. Trump emerged, looking solemn. He waved at his supporters. Arriving on stage, he threw a couple of “Maga” baseball caps into the audience behind him. And then he embarked on his usual stump speech: how he had “won big” in his debate with “Sleepy Joe”, and how he would put America first during his second White House term. Curious observers might have noticed that he wrapped up early, leaving after just 45 minutes. Behind the scenes, something was wrong. Hicks had accompanied Trump on his trip to Minneapolis. By this point she was feeling unwell. Her symptoms were ominous: likely a cough, or headache, or both. On the journey home, Hicks was isolated in a separate part of the cabin. When it landed she exited from the back of the plane. Up until Wednesday, the president’s behaviour might be defended. After all, Hicks had cut herself off from other White House staff as soon as she fell sick. Over the next 24 hours, however, Trump continued as if nothing had happened. It was a remarkable act of hubris that may have caused the virus to spread. Key members of his administration also failed to isolate. On Thursday, Hicks tested positive. The news went through the White House like a bomb-blast, shattering the complacency that had once prevailed. Amid dismay, and one imagines fear, White House staff began wearing masks. News of Hicks’s diagnosis was not made public. The hope among senior staff was this might be kept secret. The mood was one of growing panic, according to reports. Meanwhile, some of Trump’s closest aides said they had sensed on Wednesday that Trump was feeling poorly. They put this down to tiredness caused by an intense campaign schedule. The president had seemed exhausted, one person familiar with the situation told Bloomberg. Apparently unconcerned, Trump flew to his Bedminister golf resort in New Jersey for a private fundraising event. Several aides who had been in close proximity to Hicks were due to go with him. They cancelled. At the golf club, Trump made a speech and mingled with supporters at a roundtable. As usual, he was not wearing a mask. The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who had been with Hicks on Wednesday, did not use a face covering when briefing reporters. Trump was tested for Covid-19 later on Thursday, after returning to the White House. For a little while longer it was business as usual. The president gave a telephone interview to Fox News’s Sean Hannity. Speaking from his residence, he sounded a little raspy. Trump explained that he and the first lady were both being tested for coronavirus. The result – delivered via Twitter early on Friday – came when much of America was asleep. Over the past nine months Trump has sought to diminish the significance of the virus, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans, and more than 1 million people worldwide. He has mostly spurned social distancing. For a long time he downplayed the importance of wearing masks. As caseloads have risen, Trump has pushed for states to reopen their economies. The president even blithely predicted the “virus” would disappear, as if by magic. It didn’t. And now Trump has become its most famous victim."

  Trump joked while people suffered with Covid. Well, is now the time to stop? ","Well, it’s definitely a plot twist. Like a lot of people who sat through Tuesday’s presidential debate, I’m amazed the week has ended with Donald Trump ingesting bleach, and not me. As you may vaguely have heard, the US president and his wife, Melania, have tested positive for the novel coronavirus – which feels untimely given that, mere hours earlier, Trump had been declaring: “The end of the pandemic is in sight.” Perhaps this is a one-last-job movie. Alternatively, picture a Wuhan bat staring pensively into the fireplace as its butler suggests not thinking too hard about Trump’s motivations. Some poorly facepainted men just want to watch the world burn. Still, let’s stay on track. God knows, it’s excruciatingly hard to chirp “Get well soon!” to this particular patient, but … get well soonish. Those of us who want to escape the cesspool Trump has helped drag the world into will wish him a better time with the virus than the one to which he blithely condemned so many of those he was elected to serve. Each to their own, but I’m against all forms of the death penalty, karmic or otherwise. Jokes, though? Oh, jokes are very much permitted at this stage. I consider myself deeply pro-joke, for moral reasons. I appreciate that the Old Testament isn’t exactly a gagfest, but I believe in a joke for a joke, you know? And no one – NO ONE – has told more jokes about the coronavirus than Donald Trump. He’s the Covid Joker, if you’ll permit another Gotham callback. He would surely want us to follow his lead. The very last thing Trump would wish to imply is that his life is worth any more than the lives of all those people who were dying when he was joking about masks, joking about Joe Biden and masks, joking about Biden being practically dead ... to say nothing of all those times past when he joked about Hillary Clinton’s pneumonia, or had his proxies joke speculatively that she had suffered a stroke, or was afflicted by dysphasia, or had secretly suffered a serious brain trauma … I’m sorry, I’m running very low on space here. The point is, this is what he’d WANT – because he loves the lulz. Please honour him thusly. Anyway, as Trump pointed out last week, the virus “affects virtually nobody”, and has currently only affected 200,000 American nobodies to death. Arguably the real victims here are the president’s MAGA disciples, who are devoted to him but also don’t believe the virus even exists. Trump being officially diagnosed with it is category 5 cognitive dissonance – a logical contradiction so intense it could crash their circuitry, causing them to immediately lay down their assault rifles and open a chain of abortion clinics. And so to the political implications of Trump’s Covid diagnosis, which I couldn’t predict less accurately if I were picking through some sacrificed goat entrails. Joe Biden is already under pressure to suspend his campaign, just as Trump totally would if the boot were on the other foot. Then again, who knows – maybe the boot is on both feet? On Tuesday, the world watched the ancient esoteric ritual whereby leadership of the tribal land of America is decided by two septuagenarian males spending 90 minutes spraying spittle at each other, apparently after drinking ayahuasca. A somewhat primitive society, all told, though supposedly it’s culturally insensitive to point that sort of thing out these days. Perhaps there’s a certain neatness to the conclusion that virtually all reality TV elimination formats now look more sophisticated than the US election. It could really only elevate the contest if Trump and Biden were forced to battle out the rest of the campaign in isolation in a multi-camera McMansion, or on a specially adapted tropical island, or atop an abandoned karaoke soundstage. Unfortunately, the entire planet has to keep watching the show for the age-old reason. Namely, that when America shits the bed, the rest of the world has to lie in it. (That’s actually not one of Henry Kissinger’s famous adages, trivia buffs, though I’m happy for it to be included in The Little Book of Realpolitik.) On a personal level, meanwhile, it’s not clear how President Trump will cope with the standard Covid isolation lifestyle: holing up in front of endless hours of TV and communicating only by social media. He famously cheats so wantonly at golf that it’s reasonable to imagine him continuing to notch up record-breaking scorecards at his various courses while never leaving the White House. And while Melania says he’s not feeling below par, this isn’t the same as saying he has no symptoms. We know, for instance, the virus can affect one’s taste, suggesting Trump could order all his properties to be stripped of all animal print and reproduction gilt. Alas, the news has brought the first serious snowflake fall of the autumn, as people intensely relaxed about very young children being separated from their parents and held in cages at the border now wet their pants over a few aperçus about a man whose own wife says he is “feeling good”. According to the White House physician’s statement, “the president and first lady are both well at this time”. (Having said that, according to a 2018 White House physician’s statement, the president was 6ft 3in and weighed 239 pounds, placing him in the same physique category as a number of 30-year-old current pro athletes.) It’s quite a spectacle, anyway, watching people who only a couple of months ago were threatening revolution over their constitutional right to get a haircut or something, but are now calling for the smelling salts over mere discussion of the president’s health. Then again, it was only a couple of weeks ago that Trump was asked if he wasn’t worried about Covid spreading at his indoor rallies, eliciting the deathless reply: “I’m on a stage and it’s very far away.” Yet another reminder that all populists hate their people, some less secretly than others. This morning, it emerged that the White House had been aware of his aide Hope Hicks’s symptoms when Trump flew to a New Jersey fundraiser, where he was in much closer contact with his own supporters at a roundtable. No doubt it would be honour to be infected by him, and all that. As for the 4D chess grandmasters suggesting the whole “diagnosis” is a fake-news hoax by Trump designed to buy him two weeks of fairly uncritical coverage during the final crucial month of the election campaign …. well, it’s one conspiracy theory. There are a lot of conspiracy theories doing the rounds today – always the sign of an unhealthy democracy. (Trust us Brits on that front, because it takes one to know one.) Whichever way you slice it, though, all news media will now spend a good 23 hours a day talking about Trump and Covid – a considerable part of which is likely to zone in on his handling thereof. So … the most audacious ruse to own the libs of his entire presidency – or a simple case of severe acute respiratory syndrome? And will we ever make it out of the rabbit hole where these questions are routinely asked? • Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"
5,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/02/johnson-to-call-for-norway-style-fisheries-deal-in-eu-trade-talks,Brexit  Boris Johnson to set fishing ultimatum in crunch EU summit ,"Boris Johnson will demand that the increasingly isolated French president, Emmanuel Macron, caves in to UK demands on fishing as the price for a trade and security deal at a key meeting with the European commission president on Saturday. The prime minister will feel strengthened by comments from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Friday, when she described the fisheries deal struck by Britain with Norway this week as a “constructive indicator”. British officials argue that Norway, a non-EU member state, which conducts annual negotiations with the bloc on fishing quotas, should be the model for a post-Brexit deal on shared stocks. “I don’t think that’s a bad message at all for us, I think it is rather one that shows that one can find ways to come to an agreement,” Merkel said of the agreement between London and Oslo. Johnson will speak to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Saturday afternoon in a video-conference call to “take stock of negotiations and discuss next steps”. Von der Leyen warned on Friday that most contentious issues, including fisheries and the control of domestic subsidies, remained “completely open”. The EU now expects a deal to materialise only in late October or early November. But in a statement, the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, suggested there had been movement on the issue of state aid. He made his strongest comments on access to British waters for European fishing fleet, an issue where the EU has been internally split in recent weeks. Frost said: “On the level playing field, including subsidy policy, we continue to seek an agreement that ensures our ability to set our own laws in the UK without constraints that go beyond those appropriate to a free trade agreement. There has been some limited progress here but the EU need to move further before an understanding can be reached. “On fisheries the gap between us is unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU, risks being impossible to bridge. These issues are fundamental to our future status as an independent country.” Macron has infuriated other EU capitals by insisting that Brussels takes a tough negotiating position on fisheries in favour of the status quo under which France is a major beneficiary. A number of EU representatives in Brussels have privately counselled that a deal with the UK should not be jeopardised over fishing rights given its small economic value, prompting the French ambassador to describe such comments as “unacceptable” in one meeting. Paris has insisted on retention of the status quo, under which fishing catches in the 1970s form the basis of catches today. The UK remains fixed on replacing the common fisheries policy with a system of “zonal attachment” that would offer a significant increase in catches for British fishing fleets. Currently, Britain’s economic zone is part of common EU waters. The UK receives a fixed share based on how much its fishermen caught during a reference period between 1973 and 1978. Under the new system proposed by the UK, the two sides would agree on what percentage of shared stocks are attached to each of their European economic zones each year. Catch quotas would be organised in line with that percentage. A failure to agree annually on catches could lead to EU fleets being locked out of British waters. In his statement following the latest week of negotiations in Brussels, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who has repeatedly admitted that both sides should back down from “maximalist positions” on access to British waters, acknowledged the need for an increased haul for British fishermen. Barnier said a final deal would require “a stable, sustainable and long-term agreement on fisheries, enabling the UK to further develop its fishing opportunities, while ensuring the sustainable use of resources and protecting the activities of European fishermen and women”. On Wednesday, the Guardian revealed that Britain had offered a three-year transition period for European fishing fleets to allow them to prepare for the post-Brexit changes as part of an 11th-hour deal sweetener. The catches of EU fishermen would be “phased down” between 2021 and 2024 to offer time for European coastal communities to adapt to the changes. Speaking to journalists at the end of an EU summit in Brussels, Von der Leyen said there remained “a lot of work to do”, with 100 days left before the UK exits the single market and customs union but added: “Where there is a will there is a way.”"
7,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/02/more-than-750-students-at-northumbria-university-test-positive-for-coronavirus,Northumbria University  770 students test positive for Covid-19 ,"Northumbria University has said 770 of its students have tested positive for Covid-19, in one of the UK’s largest single-site coronavirus outbreaks, as other universities across the country reported surging case numbers. The Newcastle outbreak has taken the total number of cases among students to more than 2,000 across 65 universities, with most testing positive in the last week. Northumbria’s leaders said Covid-free students would still be able to attend classes in person and use shared facilities such as libraries, despite the size of the outbreak. Andrew Wathey, vice-chancellor of the university, told staff in an email: “As of Friday, we can confirm that we are aware of 770 Northumbria University students who have tested positive for Covid-19, of whom 78 were symptomatic. These students are all now self-isolating. “There are a number of reasons people were tested and I want to reassure you that the vast majority of these students are not unwell. “Their flatmates and any close contacts are also self-isolating for 14 days in line with government guidance and have been advised to contact NHS 119 to book a test as soon as possible should symptoms appear.” He said 11 members of staff had tested positive and were self-isolating. The University of Newcastle also reported an increase in infections, saying 94 students and seven staff had tested positive. The two universities issued a joint statement saying their Covid response teams were trying to trace all staff and students who had been in contact with those infected, as well as helping the hundreds of students in isolation with food and other support, including mental health services. Newcastle city council said it was working to manage the outbreak, in a “joint gold group” involving the universities, the local authority and Public Health England. Staff at Northumbria said their university had aggressively insisted on face-to-face tuition for the majority of students. Last month the University and College Union (UCU) branches at Newcastle and Northumbria said they had “serious concerns” about the universities’ plans to deal with outbreaks. Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary said: “We told Northumbria University they had a civic duty to put the health of staff, students and the local community first and we take no pleasure in now seeing another preventable crisis play out. The university sector and the government must address this public health crisis immediately.” A staff member at Northumbria told PA Media that classes were often half-full as so many students were already staying away. “We have high anxiety levels among staff and students who have a sense that the establishment is not listening to those anxieties about face-to-face teaching,” the staff member said. “There’s a lot of frustration because almost everything that we deliver face to face could be done much more safely online.” But Wathey said the size of the outbreak – bigger than those seen in UK factories or other individual institutions – “reflects the good access to and availability of testing, as well as rigorous and robust reporting systems”. The vice-chancellor claimed that where universities had started their term earlier, “numbers of student cases surged in the induction week and then reduced”. New reports of infections at universities including Nottingham Trent and Bournemouth took the total number of universities with confirmed cases to 65 in little over two weeks. In Scotland, the universities of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Napier reported more than 300 confirmed cases among their students, while the University of Glasgow had more than 170 and the University of Aberdeen said it had 99 cases. In England, Manchester University announced 221 cases among students and staff just 10 days after the university reopened for the new academic year. At the nearby Manchester Metropolitan University, UCU members passed a motion calling for the vice-chancellor, Malcolm Press, to resign over his allegedly “bungled” handling of the coronavirus outbreak, after more than 1,500 students were ordered into isolation. Sheffield University has recorded more than 200 cases since the start of the week, including 91 positive tests among its students on Thursday alone."
8,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/harvey-weinstein-facing-six-new-sexual-assault-charges,Harvey Weinstein  Convicted rapist facing six new sexual assault charges ,"Harvey Weinstein, the convicted rapist and imprisoned film mogul, is facing six new sexual assault charges, prosecutors in Los Angeles announced on Friday. Weinstein, 68, was charged with three additional forcible rape felonies and three forcible oral copulation charges stemming from alleged attacks between 2004 and 2010 in Beverly Hills. The new criminal complaint expands the LA case to a total of five victims, authorities said. The disgraced movie producer, who is serving a 23-year prison sentence for rape after a high-profile New York trial, has been facing a criminal case in California since January. He was first charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents in a two-day period in 2013 in LA. In April, the LA district attorney’s office expanded the case, accusing him of sexually assaulting another woman at a hotel in May 2010. Two of the charges announced this week relate to an alleged rape that occurred sometime between September 2004 and 2005. The other new charges relate to a fifth victim who was raped on two separate occasions between November 2009 and November 2010, according to court filings. Both victims were attacked in a Beverly Hills hotel, prosecutors said. One of the original LA allegations comes from a model who already provided a detailed account when she testified in New York. She told the jury that Weinstein invited her to a Beverly Hills hotel room, led her into a bathroom and undressed, saying, “He stepped in front of me when I went to approach the door with his naked body right in front of me. I felt so trapped … I said, ‘no, no, no’, the whole time.” If convicted on all 11 counts he is currently facing in LA, he could face up to 140 years to life in California prison, the district attorney said. Weinstein’s closely watched trial in Manhattan became the most significant criminal case of the #MeToo movement that launched in 2017 after a string of actors and celebrities publicly accused the producer of sexual harassment, abuse and rape throughout his career. Donna Rotunno, Weinstein’s lead defense attorney in the New York case, faced widespread backlash for her intense character assassination of the six women who testified, accusing them of seeking money and spreading lies, and blaming them for maintaining relationships with the producer. Advocates for survivors of sexual violence were particularly enraged at the lawyer’s remarks to a reporter that she had never been assaulted “because I would never put myself in that position”. In January, the LA district attorney, Jackie Lacey, said it took her two years for her office to build the case, and prosecutors have said that one woman did not initially report the assault because Weinstein “threatened her life if she disclosed”. It is unclear when an LA trial could move forward. California prosecutors are pursuing temporary custody of Weinstein from New York and have scheduled an extradition hearing for December in Buffalo, where he is currently incarcerated. He tested positive for Covid in March. Weinstein and his legal team have repeatedly denied all criminal allegations. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an inquiry."
10,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/02/post-office-apologises-in-false-accounting-scandal-climbdown,‘Historical failings’  Post Office apologises in false accounting scandal climbdown ,"The Post Office has decided not to oppose 44 of the 47 appeals lodged by former subpostmasters who were convicted of false accounting, theft, or fraud in a scandal that exposed severe flaws in its Horizon IT system. Acknowledging “historical failings”, the Post Office chairman, Tim Parker, said the organisation would cooperate with the Criminal Cases Reviews Commission, which has referred the cases to the court of appeal for re-examination. The admission is a further blow to the Post Office which wrongly accused large numbers of subpostmasters of criminal activity owing to inaccurate records in the Horizon IT system, which was introduced to Post Office branches in 1999. The plight of the managers was intensified by the fact that the Post Office was the private prosecuting authority, supposed victim and guardian of the disputed evidence in all the cases. Parker said: “I am sincerely sorry on behalf of the Post Office for historical failings which seriously affected some postmasters. “Post Office is resetting its relationship with postmasters with reforms that prevent such past events ever happening again. “All postmasters entitled to claim civil compensation because of their convictions being overturned [should be] recompensed as quickly as possible.”A disclosure exercise, overseen by external criminal law specialists, is being carried out to identify material that might affect the safety of prosecutions. Paul Harris, a solicitor at the law firm Edward Fail Bradshaw and Waterson, and Sam Stein QC, who represented three claimants, said: “This follows a belated acceptance by the Post Office of the unreliability of the material generated by the Horizon software and the failure by the Post Office to make proper disclosure. “We hope that this is the first step to their securing justice and bringing an end to the suffering that they have been caused by these improper prosecutions.” Hudgell Solicitors, which represented 33 clients, said the convictions will now be quashed by the court of appeal. “For the Post Office to concede defeat and not oppose these cases is a landmark moment, not only for these individuals but, in time, potentially hundreds of others,” said solicitor Neil Hudgel. “Clearing their names has been their driving goal from day one, as their reputations and livelihoods were so unfairly destroyed. “We must never forget that these people endured years of suffering and how these allegations and convictions affected not only the individuals themselves, but their loved ones too. “We have secured what amounts to a clear admission from the Post Office that people were convicted of crimes on the basis of unsafe and unreliable evidence.” Four years after losing her husband, Julian, to bowel cancer, and 12 years after he was convicted of false accounting by the Post Office, Karen Wilson, 65, spoke of her determination to clear his name. He had been “meticulous” in his running of the Post Office, which they bought in Astwood Bank, Worcestershire in 2001. After a profitable first couple of years, he started experiencing troubles with the Horizon system. When auditors arrived he was initially “delighted” because he believed the problems would be resolved. He had a shortfall in excess of £27,000 and handed over nine years’ worth of accounts for the auditors to investigate. The Post Office suspended him and said his only option was to plead guilty to false accounting, as that would prevent him from going to prison. The couple had to sell their Post Office to pay back the money which was alleged to have gone missing. “He was given 300 hours community service and he used to have to go out cleaning graveyards with other criminals. It was heartbreaking seeing my husband, who had done nothing wrong, having to do that,” said Wilson. “He knew it was the system right from the start but nobody would listen. Nobody wanted to listen. I have been determined to see this through to clear his name and have his conviction overturned.”"
11,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/02/first-new-deep-coalmine-in-uk-for-30-years-gets-green-light,Coal  First new deep mine in UK for 30 years gets green light ,"Plans to open the UK’s first new deep coalmine in 30 years have been given the go-ahead by councillors in Cumbria. West Cumbria Mining (WCM) said it plans to mine under the seabed to extract around 2.7m tonnes of metallurgical coal annually, which is solely for use within industry and not for power stations. Steel and chemical factories in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire and Port Talbot are expected to burn the coal’s output, with the company arguing that the coal will replace imports and will not increase emissions because it will not be shipped over from the US. The move comes almost five years after the country’s last deep coalmine – the Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire – closed and two months after England’s last coalmine – the surface mine in Bradley near Durham – extracted its last coal. The decision to press ahead with the new mine, Woodhouse colliery, has been made despite protests by climate campaigners including Extinction Rebellion who have argued that the new coalmine, which will reportedly emit 8m tonnes of carbon annually, contradicts the UK’s pledge to be carbon neutral by 2050. A judicial review brought by campaign groups – after councillors had twice unanimously approved the plans – forced the application to be amended. The £160m mine must now shut by 2049. Councillors on Cumbria county council’s planning committee voted 12-3 on Friday afternoon to grant planning permission to the project, with two abstentions. Mark Kirkbride, chief executive of West Cumbria Mining, said: “Woodhouse colliery will bring significant local benefits to Whitehaven, Copeland and Cumbria in terms of jobs and investment, at a critical time given the impacts of Covid-19 upon employment and economics both locally and nationally.” Robert Jenrick, the housing minister, will now face pressure to block the plans. Assuming the mine becomes operational, the metallurgical coal will supply UK and European steel-making plants, which currently import around 60m tonnes a year from the US, Canada, Russia and Australia."

Dent said on Thursday that she had just found out that the initial printing of Word Perfect, which is described by its publisher as a “brilliant linguistic almanac”, had been completed using an early version of the text. “I’m so sorry about this. I’ll be in touch as soon as I can with details on how we’re going to fix it,” said Dent on Twitter, where she described herself as “gutted” over the error. Her publisher John Murray also apologised. “We’re very sorry that, due to a printing error, early copies of Word Perfect are not word perfect. We’re taking urgent steps to recall these copies, reprint and resolve this swiftly,” it said, adding that customers needing a replacement should get in touch. However, copies have already made it to many UK bookshops. Dent told the Times: “I just opened it up and saw there was something wrong in the acknowledgments. And then I had to close it because I felt a bit sick. There are quite a few errors.

14,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/covid-cases-among-secondary-school-aged-children-rise-in-england,England  Covid cases among secondary school-aged children rise ,"The number of coronavirus cases among secondary school-aged children in England have begun to rise, with those in the later years believed to be the main driver for the increase in infections. While sixth-form students and adults aged up to 24 recorded the highest proportion of infections in England towards the end of September, cases have started to rise in the year 7 to 11 age group, where the oldest students are 16. The upward trend in the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics shows that infections among year 7 to 11 pupils have risen steadily since the end of August, to 0.3%. In the next age group up, those from year 12 to the age of 24, nearly half a per cent are estimated to have the virus. “Cases have risen fastest in the 12- to 24-year-old age group. As a group, this age range is among the least likely to suffer serious illness from Covid but some of them will and will be left with life-changing complications,” said James Naismith, a professor of structural biology at the University of Oxford. The analysis, based on nose and throat swabs taken from nearly 300 households across England, shows that infections among primary school children are flat or may even have declined since mid-September. Prof Russell Viner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who attends meetings of Sage, the government’s acientific advisory group for emergencies, said it was important not to blame uncontrolled socialising among young people for the upward trend in cases. Those who have left school to live in shared houses may be particularly at risk, he said, and and young adults were most likely to have low-paid jobs that put them most at risk. He said school outbreaks should also be put in perspective. “The evidence suggests that transmission in schools is very limited, even in secondary schools,” adding that “it is likely that much of the transmission among groups of young people may be outside school settings, as we really have limited evidence of transmission within schools”. The ONS estimates that across England, 116,600 people had coronavirus in the week studied, from 18 to 24 September, up from 103,600 in the week before. That equates to about 8,400 new cases a day and about one in 500 infected. Outbreaks in the north of England continue to drive the epidemic, with infection rates reaching 0.5% in the north-west and north-east. Substantial transmission in Yorkshire and the Humber has seen infection rates reach 0.3%, with infections in London close behind. In its previous report, issued last week, the ONS estimated that in mid-September there were about 9,600 new infections per day in England. The figures suggest that while infections are still rising, the rate of growth may have slowed, though the ONS stressed that without more data it could not confirm this. The statisticians are similarly cautious about hints of decline in Wales and Northern Ireland. This week, the ONS puts the proportion of people infected at one in 500 in Wales and one in 400 in Northern Ireland, compared with one in 300 for both regions in its last report. “The rate of new infections definitely rose quite substantially during August and early September, and the new evidence indicates that this rise may be levelling off, though that isn’t yet by any means certain,” said Kevin McConway, the emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University. According to Sage, the latest R value – the average number of people an infected person infects – stands at 1.3 to 1.6 across the UK, with the number of cases growing by 5% to 9% per day. The figures are a marginal rise on last week, when the R value stood between 1.2 and 1.5 and the UK-wide growth rate was between 4% and 8%. In England, the latest figures from Sage put the R value at or above 1 in all regions. If R is above 1, cases have the potential to rise exponentially. Given the time-lag in some of the data Sage use to calculate R, the figure tends to reflect the state of the epidemic in the preceding two or three weeks. This may explain why the numbers do not show any hint of the growth rate slowing, as found by researchers at Imperial College this week."
15,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/02/carry-on-coronavirus-shine-has-come-off-johnson-as-tory-conference-begins-party-turmoil,'Carry on coronavirus'  Shine has come off Johnson as Tory conference begins ,"When Boris Johnson barrelled into the scrum of Conservative party conference in Birmingham two years ago, he received a welcome more suited to a rockstar than a backbencher. Some breathless delegates had waited four hours to be part of the 1,500-strong audience for his speech at a fringe event. They cheered their hero uproariously, as he condemned Theresa May’s Brexit deal as an “outrage” that would trap the UK “in the tractor beam of Brussels”. This year, there will be no live audience at the conference; and the hype, which surrounded Johnson when he was the “prince across the water”, seems a distant memory. A poll of grassroots members conducted by the ConHome website on the eve of the conference found just 28% thought Johnson was dealing with the coronavirus pandemic well; 63% said he was dealing with it badly. As the government lurches from one U-turn to another, antagonising a growing number of Tory MPs, those sympathetic to Johnson blame his powerful advisers, including Dominic Cummings, for curtailing the boosterish “Boris” they knew and loved. “People feel that Boris is not the Boris he was. Something has happened to him,” said one erstwhile supporter. Steve Baker, the ringleader of this week’s 80-strong backbench rebellion over coronavirus restrictions, likened Johnson to Tolkein’s King Théoden, “under the spell” of his advisers. “When Theoden awakes, and I mean Boris, everything will come right,” Baker said. At a recent meeting with the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, to feed back the mood of the restive parliamentary party to the prime minister, members were taken aback when Johnson arrived with a “praetorian guard” of seven aides. “It was insane. One of the advisers walks up and gives him a paper to read out. It was suffocating. He’s out of the hospital, but the special advisers are keeping him in intensive care.” For veteran Tory MPs always sceptical about Johnson’s suitability for the job of prime minister, there is no surprise at the fumbled communications and the sense he is not on top of policy detail. When asked whether the shine has come off Johnson’s premiership, one former cabinet minister replied tartly: “If you drop something which is entirely ornamental into a corrosive acid bath, it tends to lose its appeal.” Out in the country, Tory members’ scepticism about Johnson comes despite the fact that most will not have been at the sharp end of the latest coronavirus restrictions, which have created a complex patchwork of curbs imposed across much of north-east and north-west England. Yet the bungles and mistakes still rankle. One Tory MP in a constituency in southern England said his local members were often small business-owners or professionals, who were bewildered at what they saw as a clownish lack of professionalism in Downing Street. “It’s like ‘carry on coronavirus’, with Boris as Sid James and Matt Hancock as Kenneth Williams,” he said. For the red wall MPs and their local associations, Johnson remains the leader who swept them to victory last December, in seats they hardly dared hope they could win. Many remain inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt … for the moment, at least. Aidan Ruff, a party member of 31 years, is president of Northumberland Conservatives association, which covers Hexham, Wansbeck, Berwick, and Blyth Valley. He said Tory members in the area had been broadly understanding. “I think most people think he’s making the best of a bad job. That’s the impression I get. The only grumble I’ve heard is people sort of saying, ‘Can we not get more testing done?’ Because that’s obviously the key. “The secondary one is probably messaging … how lockdown rules apply. It’s kind of really simple, just keep yourselves away from people if you’re not well. It doesn’t really need to be a lot more complicated than that.” Asked about Johnson’s poor polling among party members, Ruff said: “This is not Boris’s natural field of play, so I think he was always going to have difficulty with this … Fighting a pandemic, it’s a very technical thing, it’s not his forte.” He added: “The pressure he must be under at the minute, how he can keep a smile on his face, I have no idea. Most people would be running round in circles flapping their arms screaming.” Julian Arnold, the chairman of the Conservative association in Blackburn, which has also endured localised restrictions, was also sympathetic to Johnson. “I wouldn’t have his job for all the tea in China,” said Arnold. “We made him our leader, the country elected him as leader but there are idiosyncrasies with Boris, you know what I mean? I do get from members, ‘Well, that’s Boris, isn’t it?’” Most MPs representing red wall seats appear equally inclined to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt – but some report that their constituents are chafing against the latest coronavirus restrictions. “A lot of that good will is still there,” said one MP elected in 2019. But they also highlighted concerns among Conservative colleagues, especially about the 10pm curfew for hospitality businesses, which they described as a “kick in the guts to our local service sector”. “This measure, particularly, is causing us real concerns locally. As one fellow Tory MP in a red wall seat said to me, ‘We’ve gone from eat out to help out, to drink up and piss off,” said the MP. “It is a real, real problem now. It doesn’t feel like it’s being applied clearly and the lack of scientific evidence for it is also a major concern.”  But Sajjad Karim, who served as a Tory MEP for the north-west for 15 years until 2019, predicted that worries about jobs and the economy could eventually prompt the notoriously ruthless Conservative party to turn on the prime minister. Asked about Tory support in red wall seats, Karim said: “Well, I think those MPs are going to be increasingly worried next year because many of them have been elected only for the first time, personally. And many of those seats have been won after many, many, many years, if not for the first time ever and their majorities are not great.” If the prime minister appears to be a drag on their electoral prospects, he added, “They will move to remove Boris Johnson to try to protect their own position.” Approval ratings can go up, as well as down, and much will depend on the economic fallout from the pandemic – and from Brexit. A flurry of upbeat conference announcements are planned in an attempt to return to the optimistic mood of last December’s election landslide, and the “levelling up” agenda that was meant to define Johnson’s premiership. If a vaccine emerges to allow something like normal life to return, and a Brexit deal is reached with the EU to limit the immediate fallout from the end of the transition period in January, even Johnson’s critics believe he could restore much of his lost popularity with the public. But it is hard to imagine him ever being quite the conference pin-up he was two years ago."
16,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/the-land-that-time-forgot-months-of-lockdown-grate-in-northern-england-coronavirus,'The land that time forgot'  Months of lockdown grate in northern England ,"Donna Burrell sits in her darkened restaurant. There are no customers today and there will be none for the rest of the week. Normally, Salotto, the Italian restaurant which sits at the heart of her thriving co-operative business in Bolton that also houses a bridal boutique and furniture store, would be a hive of activity. There would be the sounds of chatting, the hum of the espresso machine and the clinking of champagne glasses as brides celebrated buying their dream dress. But this Thursday afternoon there is just silence. It’s the same in Rosalyn Wilde’s home in Trafford, and James Murgatroyd’s home in Bradford. And it’s been this way for nearly all of the past six months. While much of the country has enjoyed a return to some semblance of normality this summer, with the strictest coronavirus restrictions lifted, swathes of northern England have had just a few weeks’ respite from curbs. These northern boroughs and towns came out of lockdown with the rest of the country on 4 July, but just weeks later had local measures introduced preventing them from – to differing degrees – seeing family, opening businesses and visiting pubs or restaurants. Months after these measures were imposed, a Guardian analysis on Thursday underlined figures showing what many already suspected: local lockdowns, designed to bring Covid under control, are not working. Now, as we creep towards winter, there is an overwhelming feeling in these areas of having been forgotten, of “lockdown prejudice”, being left under restrictions when others have enjoyed the little freedom the country may experience this year. And some infuriated residents and politicians vent anger at a widening north-south divide – a suspicion that if stricter curbs applied to the capital and southern England, there would be more urgency and more anger over the limits on their daily lives. Murgatroyd, a proud Bradfordian whose daughter has a chronic health condition, says he has taken the virus seriously since day one, but has begun to despair at the government’s approach. And he predicts ministers’ fractured and, in his view, culturally insensitive attempt to stem the virus with “knee-jerk” local restrictions means that tensions will pervade for years to come. He says: “Much has been made of the BAME communities being responsible for the spread of the virus, and when they brought in restrictions on the eve of Eid they showed a complete lack of understanding of what the situation was on a local level … I see large numbers of white people of all ages walking around shops with no mask yet Pakistanis were being blamed for spreading the virus. “This is just one example of the damage that has been done by local lockdowns. This could have been avoided with a national approach but what we have now is communities being left to languish in never-ending local lockdowns, almost with the sense that they have been punished.” He speaks as it emerges that the SNP MP Margaret Ferrier flouted coronavirus rules by taking a train from London to Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, hot on the heels of rule-breaking by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson’s father, Stanley. “The more that MPs and advisers are seen breaking the rules without consequences then people will think, ‘Why should I bother?’ I can only see it getting worse over winter,” Murgatroyd says. Speaking from her terraced home doubling as an office, Rosalyn Wilde, a construction bid manager, is also frustrated. She has not seen her elderly grandparents all year. Her daughter, Emmeline, learned to walk during lockdown, with her close family missing the milestone. Wilde, 38, lives in Trafford, which was brought under heightened restrictions at the end of July. In early September, there was a chink of light as ministers said measures banning different households meeting indoors or in private gardens would be lifted. But the move prompted local council bosses to ask for restrictions to remain, a day before they were due to be lifted, amid concerns that the coronavirus rates were still too high. They have stayed in place ever since. Wilde and her husband, Tom, head of a charitable foundation at a housing trust, have been mainly supportive of lockdown measures, sticking to the rules religiously, but they have begun to take their toll. “If, say, London was under lockdown, parliament would be talking about it more. I feel like when the prime minister has his briefings he wouldn’t just ignore the fact that London was under different rules to the rest of the country,” she says. Sweeping her hand upwards and sighing, she adds: “These places up in the north that are under these rules – it’s easy to forget about them. The fact that we have been living with these local restrictions for a long, long time hasn’t been mentioned. They’ve just thought, ‘We’ll slap that rule on you and then we’ll just forget about it for a while.’” There is cross-party agreement in the north about the “sheer unfairness” of the lockdown rules. David Greenhalgh, the council leader in Bolton, said government handling was “breeding resentment”. The Conservative Bolton West MP, Chris Green, wrote an open letter to the health secretary this week, pleading with him to bring the borough’s measures in line with the rest of Greater Manchester as cases continue to fall. Labour’s Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, described the situation as “indefensible”, with the country heading towards the most difficult winter it had ever known. “The whole approach has been too centralised, too driven from rooms within Whitehall without any recognition about what this means for people on the ground and how it affects our communities,” Burnham said. “There is this lack of consistency that is making people lose faith. The sense of injustice is very real today. You can’t have this situation where you introduce restrictions and forget about places with your attention wandering off somewhere else.” Burnham said: “If we go into a winter with the north under local restrictions – millions of people under restrictions – we are going to see a widening of the north-south divide. This is a real danger that is staring us right in the face.” Back in the Bolton suburb of Astley Bridge on Thursday, Donna Burrell is celebrating. A notification on her phone alerts her to a speech by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announcing that Bolton’s lockdown restrictions will be aligned with the rest of Greater Manchester. Twenty-three days earlier, extra restrictions had been imposed, with restaurants, bars and pubs told to close to visitors due to a rise in coronavirus cases, with the government insisting – as it has throughout – that these are necessary, if painful, steps designed to save lives. Since then, the restaurant in Burrell’s co-operative has been closed and, despite virus rates in other boroughs rising higher than Bolton’s, no area in the country had been subjected to the same measures. Burrell, who started a petition signed by 3,000 people pleading with the government to lift the restrictions, says the decision by ministers has cost her business £50,000 – but she is one of the lucky ones. Others in the area’s hospitality industry have been forced to close. The 50-year-old from nearby Darwen is incensed. “We are all celebrating now but in these 23 days that we have been closed there are going to be businesses that cannot reopen,” she says. “Every night I drove home, I would see all of Bolton’s pubs and restaurants closed and within half a mile all of Darwen’s pubs and restaurants open and everyone in Bolton going to other towns. The amount of money that has leaked out of Bolton is phenomenal.” There is joy and relief at Hancock’s decision. Following the announcement, watched by all the staff on Burrell’s phone, the lights are switched on immediately and restaurant staff are told to return. But there is a lingering resentment in the room. “We were definitely forgotten,” says Burrell. “I can’t understand and will never understand the local lockdown decisions.” Burrell argues that the decision to close Bolton’s hospitality industry allowed the virus to spread to neighbouring boroughs, with the public traveling a few miles to places with fewer restrictions to eat out and shop. “It made no sense and nobody has ever explained it to us. We have watched 26 other boroughs’ infection rates up and down the UK go higher and higher but yet no similar restrictions. The silence from Westminster these past few weeks has been deafening,” she says. “We are occupying the land that time forgot.”"
18,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/02/almost-20000-amazon-workers-in-us-test-positive-for-covid-19,"Amazon  Almost 20,000 workers in US test positive for Covid-19 ","Amazon has revealed that almost 20,000 of its workers in the US have contracted Covid-19 after months of demands for public disclosure from activists. The US tech company has been one of the biggest corporate winners during the pandemic, with people across the world switching to online shopping during lockdowns. However, Amazon has faced criticism from some labour campaigners who alleged that the company put employees in danger by keeping warehouses open. In a blogpost, Amazon said that its analysis suggested that the rate of infection among 1.4 million workers at Amazon and its Whole Foods subsidiary was 42% lower than the rate expected based on the broader US population. A state-by-state breakdown of the cases showed that the highest rate of infection of Amazon employees was in Minnesota, where 3.17% of Amazon workers were presumed to have caught Covid-19, double the rate of infection in the broader population. However, the data did not give absolute numbers of infected workers in each state or whether workers in warehouses were more vulnerable. Amazon, which has a market value of $1.6tn (£1.2tn) and whose largest shareholder is its founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, said it was investing “hundreds of millions of dollars” in its own coronavirus testing programme. It plans to conduct 50,000 tests a day across 650 sites by November. Athena, a coalition of US activist groups campaigning for greater regulatory oversight over Amazon, called for immediate investigations into the company by public health officials as well as regular reporting on the number of employees with Covid-19. Athena’s director, Dania Rajendra, said in a statement: “Amazon allowed Covid-19 to spread like wildfire in its facilities, risking the health of tens of thousands of people who work at Amazon – as well as their family members, neighbours and friends. “Amazon is, in no uncertain terms, a threat to public health.” Amazon’s blogpost said the company gives its employees comprehensive health insurance and paid time off for any worker who needs to be quarantined. It has also instituted new cleaning regimes and other processes to reduce the spread of the virus, the company said."
19,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/02/humpback-whales-sing-alaska-covid-summer-researchers,'It's a really big deal'  Humpback whales seize chance to sing in Alaska's cruise-free Covid summer ,"Sign up for monthly updates on America’s public lands For Alaskans, summertime means cruise ships. Lots of cruise ships. The 2020 season was expected to commence with a record-breaking deluge of 1.4 million tourists and glacier gazers  that would effectively triple the state’s scant population of 730,000. Once the pandemic hit, that number effectively dropped to zero. “The town of Skagway gets a million people a year off cruise ships and is just completely shut down,” said Paul Swanstrom, longtime bush pilot and founder of Mountain Flying Service, which operates out of the southern Alaska community. “It’s nuts. All the south-east has been hit pretty hard.” Yet although the economy is being decimated by the reduction in tourist vessels, the state’s humpback whales are some of the few locals actually enjoying the silence. Dr Michelle Fournet, director of the Sound Science Research Collective and research fellow at Cornell University, has been listening in on whale conversations for 10 years, but never before has she seen a summer like this. “It’s the first time in human history that we’ve had the technological ability to listen to these whales in a meaningful way without us interfering … it’s a really, really big deal. “The last time researchers were able to listen to humpbacks in a quiet ocean in Alaska was in 1976,” when commercial whale watching began, said Fournet, and their population was much lower as humpback whaling was banned only a decade earlier. Since that time, recording technology has come a long way and whale populations have seen a huge resurgence, with several thousand summering in south-east Alaska alone. (Though most of their populations worldwide are now labeled ‘not at risk’, four of fourteen groups are still considered endangered.) Most whale watching in Alaska happens out of Juneau’s Auke Bay, and it’s one of the most popular excursions for those visiting on a cruise ship. More than one-quarter of all passengers opt for this day tour, which amounts to over 350,000 travelers packing the boats each year, according to Suzie Teerlink, marine mammal specialist with Noaa Fisheries. On a busy day, there can be 10 or more whale-watching vessels clustering around a single whale or group, prompting concerns about vessel overcrowding. With as many as 65 whale-watching boats zooming around Juneau and nearby Glacier Bay national park on any given day during the summer, humpbacks change their behavior in two distinct ways: they call louder and they call less. “When an animal calls less, the likelihood of it finding a comrade goes down significantly,” said Fournet. “So, we alter their social structure.” This year “we’re going to see how these humpback whales are interacting with their environment instead of how they’re interacting with us. You can’t figure out whether or not your species is resilient to something if you don’t know what it acts like when it’s happy.” Researchers are also gathering blubber biopsies to analyze the animals’ stress hormones during the 2020 season. They obtain the samples by firing an untethered biopsy dart or bolt from a modified .22 rifle or crossbow – researchers argue that this causes only limited harm - and compare the cortisol levels against samples collected from the same whales in 2014. “We are still amidst data collection and so it’s too soon to report any numbers or results,” said said Dr Heidi Pearson, associate professor of marine biology at University of Alaska Southeast. “But, based on my observations, it does seem that whales are exhibiting more resting behavior this year … I have also observed larger groups and more social behavior than I have in previous years.” The goal of the studies is to establish a meaningful behavioral baseline and better understand the impacts tour boats have on marine creatures. “We are committed to ensuring that whale-watching tourism is done in a responsible and sustainable way,” said Noaa’s Teerlink. “I am hopeful that we will be able to use this pause to work together with our industry partners to think outside the box and move forward with conservation and sustainability in mind.” Scientists are keenly aware that it is often the whale-watching trips themselves that help sway the public to support and fund protective measures.  “We’re not going to eliminate cruise ships, nor should we,” said Fournet, “They’re really important economically and for people to interact with their environment … but what I hope is that as we start to ramp the noise back in we can identify the tipping point.” Fournet was ecstatic after listening to her first hydrophone recordings of the year two weeks ago. “It’s really, really quiet. [On] my very first pass of listening, I randomly picked a file, and I immediately heard a whale instead of a boat.” The state may be facing a big economic downturn, but this is at least one fact to take comfort in, she said. “Even though we are not on the ocean right now, the whales are still there,” said Fournet. “They’re there whether we are watching them or not, and that is a very comforting thing.” Dr Fournet’s 2020 whale recordings will soon be available at the Sound Science Collective website"
20,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/02/mortimer-and-whitehouse-gone-fishing-mens-health-male-friendship,'I had no idea how touching it would be'  How a fishing show put men's health in focus ,"A couple of years ago, early in his time as controller of BBC Two, Patrick Holland got a call asking if he’d have a meeting with Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse, who wanted to pitch an idea. Of course, he was a massive fan: they were comedy heroes of his in the 90s. But then the meeting happened and Holland’s heart sank, because the project turned out to be one about … fishing. “I thought: I’m new on the job, the first thing on my to-do list was not going to be a show about two old guys going fishing together,” says Holland, before changing “old guys” to “older gentlemen” and then settling on “middle-aged” (Mortimer and Whitehouse are now 61 and 62). As the meeting went on, though, it became clear that it wasn’t all, or even very much, about fishing but more about friendship and mortality. It would be very funny because Mortimer and Whitehouse are very funny. They cast their wit and their charm and Holland took the bait, though when he told his channel team “I sort of slightly cringed because I thought no one is going to think that this is the future of television.” Maybe it is though: with the credits pretty much still rolling at the end of the third series of Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing (over a drone shot of the beautiful River Wye), Holland has just commissioned a fourth. The idea started off, before that meeting, not as an idea for television at all. Mortimer had had triple heart bypass surgery; he was depressed. Whitehouse, who’d also had heart problems, offered to take him fishing. “Paul is a very thoughtful person,” says the show’s executive producer, Lisa Clark. “He knew Bob was feeling quite down and scared to go out.” It was only when they got to the river and started chatting and larking about that they thought there could be something in it. That authenticity is the show’s secret, says Clark. “We didn’t put them together because they’d be funny, they’d been friends for years, it was a genuine offer from Paul to help Bob.” Any doubts Holland had about giving them the green light disappeared when he got to see it. He knew it would be humorous, “but I had no idea until those first episodes started to come back just how special and touching it would be. And open and difficult, in the way both of them approach subjects that men of the age might find hard to discuss.” The first series was a lot about being ageing men and their dicky tickers. They’ve gone on to talk about childhood, friendship, parents, loss, memories, children. Fishing and fish, too: they’ve even caught a few, before putting them gently back into the water. It has done well, growing to a little under 2 million viewers. It has also hit something of a nerve. A quick Twitter scan for #GoneFishing reveals, from @1StevieKilner: “Really good to hear Bob Mortimer discussing depression @MVGoneFishing. For me, the man has long been a pick-me-up during difficult times and he and Paul have gone a long way to reminding us of the wonderful things that come from true friendship.” From @FrancescaCawood: “Mortimer and Whitehouse’s Gone Fishing is the best antidote to ‘all of this’.” And so many more. Dr Anand Patel, a GP and men’s health specialist at the Centre for Men’s Health, appeared on the final episode of the last series, joining Mortimer and Whitehouse to talk about men’s stuff – down there, up there, all over. His impression was of a very complementary relationship. “You get a great sense of what male friendship is,” he says. Friendships are so important, Patel says. Men aren’t always brilliant at keeping them going, about getting back in touch with someone they haven’t seen for a while because work or family has got in the way. “It’s not about saying: do you want to come and talk? It’s like: do you fancy coming and doing something – the cinema, the pub, whatever your bag is? Bumping along shoulder to shoulder rather than necessarily face to face seems to be important, it takes the pressure off talking.” Men are also negligent of their health, both physical and mental, Patel says. “One of the reasons men’s life expectancy is shorter is that they generally arrive [at the doctor] much later in an illness, in cancer say – they’ve had cancer for longer.” Along with erectile dysfunction, mental health is the most difficult thing to bring up. It is improving, says Patel, younger generations are better about talking, to doctors and to friends. But in over-50s, three-quarters of suicides are men. “Men can talk about their feelings and their health, but it does in some sense require a catalyst,” he says. “It’s about normalising stuff as well.” That’s why it’s good news that Mortimer and Whitehouse are discussing depression as well as cardiovascular disease, their prostates and their willies so publicly on the telly. “It is so instrumental in getting people to think about themselves,” says Patel. Clark says the response has been inspiring. “We’ve had letters from people saying ‘I’m going to talk to my doctor about mental health’. I know Paul and Bob: whenever they’re out, people say ‘thank you’, ‘that helped’. Our series two director, Will Yapp, we were filming it and he felt a bit funny, he got checked out, and he ended up having heart surgery. I was like, bloody hell, it’s catching.” Clark won’t say where they’ll be fishing in the next series, but it won’t be anywhere far away. As well as all those other things, Gone Fishing is about celebrating the natural loveliness of this country. Like the final scene of the last episode, Mortimer floating off down the Wye in his “boat” (more like a bowl, as Whitehouse says), accompanied by Andrew Gold. “Hands up who wept at Thank You for Being a Friend” tweeted @magnet25433. I imagine quite a few hands went up."
22,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/02/trump-covid-diagnosis-campaign-election,US elections 2020  Trump diagnosis throws campaign into total chaos ,"Hours after the announcement that he had tested positive for Covid-19, Donald Trump canceled a planned trip to Florida for a campaign rally on Friday and announced that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, who also tested positive, would enter quarantine. “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,” Trump tweeted. “We will get through this TOGETHER!” Trump’s diagnosis promised to change the final month of the presidential campaign in profound and unforeseeable ways. In-person rallies, campaign meetings involving Trump, travel by staff, volunteer organization efforts and other mechanics of campaigning were instantly derailed as the White House scrambled to track the extent of the outbreak. The status of major campaign events still on the horizon, including two additional presidential debates with Democratic challenger Joe Biden later this month, was thrown into doubt. But over those practical matters hung the questions of whether Trump would fall ill, whether the sitting president would remain fit for office, and how his diagnosis with a dangerous and potentially fatal disease could alter supporters’ views of the disease – and of Trump. In the extreme circumstance of presidential disability, Vice-President Mike Pence could be required to temporarily assume the powers of the office – and unforeseen campaign duties. A Pence spokesman announced on Friday morning that Pence and his wife had tested negative for Covid-19. The Biden campaign issued a statement of support on Friday morning. “Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery,” Biden said. “We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.” A Biden spokesman later said the Democratic candidate and his wife had both tested negative for Covid-19. Whether Biden would change his campaign plans was another open question. After months of campaigning virtually and showing great caution over the virus, the Democratic nominee had just shifted to a series of in-person campaign events, and his campaign this week launched door-to-door canvassing across several battleground states, motivated by a need to compete with Trump’s active in-person campaigning. Reverberations could have immense scope if additional members of the White House staff, or other officials, test positive Those efforts could now be mothballed, out of deference to the president’s health – or in consideration of how Trump’s diagnosis could change public attitudes about the safety of in-person campaign events, which Biden has largely avoided this year. The biggest in-person event of the cycle, however, the first presidential debate, was only three days ago, raising a flurry of concern about the possibility that Biden, 77, had been exposed to the virus by Trump, 74, or someone in his entourage. Sitting in the audience inside the large debate hall, members of the Trump family, including the first lady, refused to wear a mask. The discombobulation of the Trump campaign over the president’s diagnosis was on display on Friday morning with a campaign e-blast sent to donors asking them to meet Trump for an upcoming rally. “Can you join President Trump?” the email read. “He’s heading to Houston, Texas next week and he specifically requested that we reach out to YOU to accompany him.” Reverberations and potential political fallout from Trump’s diagnosis could have immense scope if additional members of the White House staff, or other elected officials, test positive. The White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who tested negative on Friday, has met repeatedly with supreme court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, who has been meeting with Republican senators in an attempt to fast-track her confirmation to the bench before the presidential election. Barrett, who last met with Trump on Saturday, tested negative for coronavirus on Friday, the White House said. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said her confirmation would proceed as planned.  “Full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the Court, and the country deserve,” McConnell tweeted. But the effort to confirm Barrett could be significantly slowed by the news. The Senate judiciary committee planned to meet in-person to discuss the nomination, and the confirmation was thought to require a full vote with all senators physically present inside the Capitol Hill chamber. Mike Lee, a senator from Utah and a judiciary committee member, announced on Friday that he had tested positive for coronavirus and would work from home. More than 207,000 Americans have died of Covid-19, and the country is averaging about 43,000 new confirmed cases a day, with upticks in more than half of the 50 states. The seriousness of Covid-19 cases ranges dramatically, and the president’s course of infection and treatment is unknown. But by having to cancel in-person rallies, Trump stands to lose his most reliable tool for building enthusiasm with his base of voters, and his personal favorite mode of campaigning. The Trump campaign could also suffer badly if voters decipher his diagnosis as a failure of judgment. For months Trump has downplayed the virus, calling it a “hoax” and saying it would “disappear”. An aggressively anti-mask culture, dictated by Trump, has for weeks prevailed at the White House, according to multiple insider accounts, with staff and visitors tacitly discouraged from wearing masks in meetings. A typical incubation period of three to five days has been tracked in coronavirus cases before illness sets in, and asymptomatic carriers in many cases are not aware of their infections. Close Trump aide Hope Hicks tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, one day before the president and first lady were diagnosed. Even after Hicks’s positive diagnosis, Trump traveled to New Jersey for a campaign fundraiser, and the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, convened a briefing inside the White House that afternoon.  The Hicks diagnosis was not announced until after Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs revealed the news. On Friday, Jacobs reported that “some of Trump’s closest aides sensed on Wednesday that the president was feeling poorly”. In defiance of public health officials and over the objection of some state governors, Trump had planned a barnstorming tour of in-person events in key battleground states, including two events Saturday in Wisconsin. At the debate, Trump mocked Biden for wearing a mask. “I don’t wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask,” Trump said. “He could be speaking 200 feet away from people and he’ll be wearing the biggest mask you’ve ever seen.”"
24,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/03/take-me-away-from-all-this-how-books-save-our-souls-during-difficult-times,Take me away from all this  How books save our souls during difficult times ,"Rachel Krasky has read 95 books this year. That’s about 2.5 a week. The 30-year-old communications manager has always been a voracious reader, but Melbourne’s coronavirus lockdown has given her more time for bingeing on books. She’s one of many who have turned to reading since Covid struck, seeking to satisfy a need for escape, understanding, hope and communion. “I’ve been reading a bit of crime, probably more mystery-thrillers than usual, and a lot about relationships,” she says. “And cross-generational books, because I found that there’s a lot in them about people going through difficult times and then coming out the other side – about life struggles really, and how you get through them.” I hear about Krasky from Jane Turner, owner of Bondi bookshop-cafe Gertrude & Alice, during a bibliotherapy session – a birthday gift from my book club – designed to “cure readers of their literary ailments”. On a Friday afternoon at the end of a week off, I join Turner and two of her staff, Yehuda Aharon and Ella Sullivan, for wine, cheese and a big old chat about books. We spend over an hour talking about fictional worlds – from an epic of ancient Greek mythology, to a story of shame and desire in modern day South Korea, and the tale of a woman who inherits the unwanted dog of a friend she has lost to suicide. Our ages range from 19 to 59, but we chat easily, jumping between genres and sharing the stories we’ve loved and why they spoke to us. Although I was more focused on the “biblio” part than the “therapy” when I booked the session, I find the whole experience intensely therapeutic. Tucked away in a corner of the store after hours, surrounded by stacked shelves and nourished by delicious food and even better conversation, the pandemic all but fades away. Afterwards I speak to Sonya Tsakalakis, a former counsellor and professional bibliotherapist, to find out more about the strange alchemy that allows literature to transport us to worlds away from the everyday. “It has that meditative quality, reading fiction, you just lose sense of time,” she says. “A client calls it a reading trance – you can be on a train and you forget to get off at your stop because you’re so involved in the book.” Tsakalakis discovered the healing powers of reading as a young migrant child who had a hard time starting out at school: “There was a lot of bullying going on and I understood from an early age how powerful reading can be in offering solace, encouragement and hope. “It’s really about connecting and that’s what good writing does.” The observation reminds me of a favourite line from Henry Miller’s Sexus that I’ve carried with me since uni days: “Art isn’t a solo performance; it’s a symphony in the dark with millions of participants and millions of listeners.” In a global pandemic that has kept us at home, isolated from loved ones, isn’t that just what we need? Krasky connected to her fellow readers through social media, reaching out to friends to solicit book recommendations at the beginning of the first Melbourne lockdown. Turner’s son Jordan sent her back a video message with a list. Once she had exhausted it, Jordan introduced Krasky to Turner, who posts the books they decide on to Melbourne. They’ve never met in person but now speak three or four times a week. Krasky says her reading choices have reflected the ups and downs of pandemic life. “Sometimes I haven’t been able to pick up those books that are more on the depressing side,” she says. “They’re quite serious and you can get quite emotional … Then there’s been times when I’ve craved that deeper read about people working through their issues because that’s what reflects my journey of coronavirus.” Tsakalakis has noticed a similar phenomenon in the Zoom workshops she’s run for Melbourne libraries on reading to enhance wellbeing during the pandemic. “Some people [were] going back to rereading books,” she says. “They’re taking comfort in reading the classics or works they know have given them pleasure before and are guaranteed to give them that same sense of feeling safe. “Others were saying they needed hopeful reading. And that’s the good thing about reading a work of fiction, it’s that narrative arc … It has the beginning, the middle, and you know [it’s] is going to come to an end with a sense of hope this is not going to last forever. “And then there are people saying, ‘I just can’t read at all. I can’t concentrate with the endless news cycle.’ They [were trying] short stories, [which] are fantastic if you don’t have that capacity to engage in the long narrative, but you still want to be immersed in a story [with] all the emotions that are stirred up when you’re in a work of fiction.” I’ve felt these kinds of fluctuations in my own reading. Early on in the pandemic, just as Sydney was heading into lockdown, my book club agreed to become a film club for a while, since none of us could focus. Then, after stumbling across a New Yorker article about the phenomenon of survivor guilt among mountain climbers, I became overwhelmed with an enormous appetite for tales of Everest – as though my mind wanted to escape into the furthest thing from quarantine I could imagine. As coronavirus wore on, I recommitted to my love of fiction. Years of immersion in breaking news alerts, the cacophony of Twitter and too many longreads and not enough time to read them had caused the fiction habit that had sustained me since childhood to fall by the wayside. Covid has reawakened it. My bibliotherapy session ends with a “prescription” and I walk away with a pile of books, from The Overstory by Richard Powers to Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko and The Friend by Sigrid Nunez. I plan to prioritise giving myself the time I need to get lost in the narratives – to tap into the vast symphony of humanity contained within their pages. And what does Tsakalakis prescribe for Covid reading? “There’s a great short story collection called The Glimpse of Truth, edited by David Miller. It’s a combination of contemporary writers and classic writers … that encompasses all the emotions we’re feeling right now – joy and sorrow and despair. “Room for a Stranger [is] a beautiful book by Melanie Cheng about [an] intergenerational friendship that develops in this unlikely scenario and … they find a point of connection. So that’s a nice, hopeful sort of story to read. “Some of the classics are great, like Cloudstreet by Tim Winton. That’s comforting – there’s such a strong sense of place and very evocative images. “The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins is long, it’s circuitous, and it’s filled with intrigue, plot twists and entertainingly wicked characters that will have you turning the pages. “Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times, edited by Neil Astley, is stimulating, colossal and breathtaking. Readers of all tastes will find a poem that will speak to them. “Reading aloud is quite powerful … It’s nice to bring the story to life if you can read it aloud to someone that you love.” As for Krasky, she’s revised up the number of books she plans to read this year. “I wanted to get to 100 because I’ve never done that before, but I’m going to get there,” she says. “Now the sky’s the limit.”"
25,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/02/subway-high-street-sandwiches-reviewed-bread,Bread or unbread?   Subway and other high street sandwiches reviewed ,"The news this week that Subway bread is so sugary, according to the Irish supreme court, that it cannot, for tax purposes, be classed as bread, has left Subway customers reeling. Just kidding. The Subway empire was built on the teenage boy. Hence its strong showing on YouTube and remarkable array of sauce. Teenage boys don’t care about sugar content or, for that matter, VAT. Yet is this added sugar so unusual, or is it simply the way of the high street? And can you really taste the difference between bread and unbread? I went to sample some to find out. Turkey Ham and Cheese Sub 6 inch with cucumber, jalapeño, lettuce, red onion and chipotle southwest dressing, £3.49 You always have to make a call in Subway between a sandwich that is slightly too small (six inches) and one that is magnificently too big (one foot). As the aficionado will know, part of its appeal is the intricacy of its choices: you can have one of nine breads, all the garnish you can imagine, any or all of seven sauces. The wholemeal options are considered the more nutritious, but – spoiler alert – they’re all disgusting. I had the Italian bread, which has an unaccountable dusting of something like semolina or cornmeal, which gives it a gritty spin, like a mouthful of sand. The bread is like Vichy: no resistance, morally questionable. Another distinctive Subway tactic is that the sandwiches are mainly toasted on the interior, so the outside is like an untoasted sandwich and the cheese is still melted; it’s an innovation for the company rather than the customer, I would venture, since who knows what would happen to this bread of nothingness, this incredibly soft substance if you applied too much heat to it? Both the cheese and the meat taste as completely neutral as you can imagine, which is why everyone who goes in there puts jalapeño on everything. I love the dressing, though. Calories: 385Carbohydrates: 40gOf which sugars: 6.2gVerdict: Definitely more cake than bread, 4/10 Ham and Cheese Baguette, £4.99 This is the Tie Rack of the sandwich world – definitively 80s (the first store opened in Waterloo in 1986), largely superseded by modernity and flat refusing to give in. The sandwiches never taste as good at home as they do on the station concourse; nobody knows why. The baguette is pretty narrow, and created a stir six years ago when they were reduced from 10 inches to 9, but it’s still larger than the Subway offering, so bear that in mind for the nutritional comparison.The bread sags its way into your mouth, neither crunchy nor fluffy, not especially sweet but not exactly savoury either. The filling is extremely plain: butter, ham, cheese, nothing else. You know when you’re a kid and your mum gets annoyed with you picking bits out of your packed lunch, so for two years straight she gives you exactly the same sandwich with absolutely no variation? It tastes a bit like that. Calories: 488Carbohydrates: 52gOf which sugar: 0gVerdict: Inhabits the space between cake and bread, 6/10 Ham and Greve Baguette, £3.45 I didn’t realise what good value Pret was until I saw them all side by side. I feel like an idiot politician being astonished at the price of milk. Anyway, this is cheaper even than Subway and much larger, far cheaper than the Upper Crust, also half an inch longer and quite a bit wider. The filling is great: nice mustard mayo, a bit of lettuce for the ladies, good quality and interesting cheese, decent ham. The bread has a good mouthfeel, a lot of substance and actually tastes like bread. I wonder whether baguette is actually right for the on-the-go market, though: all the sandwiches are made freshly that day, but I bought this at 9am and it still tasted like it had seen better days. A bit late to worry about that, I suppose. The baguette is king. Calories: 615Carbohydrates: 59.5gOf which sugars: 3.9gVerdict: This is bread, slightly tired but unbowed, 8/10. Ham and cheese panino, £4.25 These are typically toasted, which is a flattering move on a panino; it tasted by far the freshest of the breads, with a pleasing crunch as you break through the outside, and a bland but not sweet interior. The inside is deceptively simple but there’s quite a lot going on: melted, mild but very salty cheddar on one side; quite a thoroughly processed ham, with that distinctive oblong shape of a meat product forged in a factory; and then something more like a béchamel sauce on the other side, totally tasteless, merely conveying comfort and squish.It tastes like the kind of sandwich you’d get on an American train in the 90s, engineered for the broadest possible appeal. Calories: 424Carbohydrates: 48gOf which sugar: 2.3gVerdict: A perfectly respectable bread, 5/10 Ham and Egg Roll, £3.05 I’m just going to talk you through my choice, here: I could have got a ham and cheese baguette, but the rolls were much more similar, in size and composition, to other sandwiches. It had been filled with an eye on efficiency over the eating experience; once the bag was open, the egg went everywhere. It was a bit spartan for my tastes: unbuttered, a lot of filling but none of it very interesting – again with the heavily processed ham, plus some tasteless tomatoes and completely unremarkable iceberg lettuce.I don’t want to clutch my pearls, but the bread I found actively insulting. It was nominally wholemeal, in the sense that it looked brown, but absolutely without bite or taste or anything to recommend it. It had an artificial quality: if you rolled it between your finger and thumb, you could compact it into a little earplug (a better quality bread would crumb). I’d say I was disappointed, except that there’s a perfectly good answer to this: when in Greggs, always get the sausage roll. Calories: 212Carbohydrates: 22gOf which sugars: 1.6gVerdict: It’s more bread than cake, but more packing material than either, 4/10"
26,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/02/is-there-still-time-for-a-brexit-trade-deal,Explainer  Is there still time for a Brexit trade deal? ,"This week the last scheduled talks were held between EU and UK negotiators on a Brexit trade and security deal. Only 90 days remain until the end of the transition period, when Britain will leave the EU’s economic system, deal or no deal. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will speak to Boris Johnson on Saturday afternoon as both sides seek common ground on the way forward, a conversation that would not be happening if a deal were impossible. But that does not mean a deal is inevitable. Far from it. After updating EU leaders on Friday, von der Leyen said there had been “progress on many, many different fields” but the most difficult questions were “still completely open”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, cast doubt on whether the gap could be closed, saying the UK was “fully committed to working hard to find solutions, if they are there to be found”. If these differences are not resolved by an EU summit on 15-16 October, the window for an agreement will rapidly close. The biggest problem, as expected from the start, is the “level playing field” – rules to ensure fair competition between British and EU companies. Brussels says its unprecedented offer of a zero-tariff trade deal, with no quantity limits on UK imports to the bloc, means abiding by EU standards on environment, worker and consumer rights and – most contentious of all – state support for companies. Agreement on the 100 categories of fish swimming in EU-UK waters remains tenuous. While no one expects a deal to be stymied by fishing, the two sides remain far apart. EU member states, such as France, the Netherlands and Belgium, that stand to see economic pain inflicted on their fishing fleets will have to judge that the final compromise is acceptable. Frost warned that the gap on fisheries remained “very large” and risked “being impossible to bridge”.  The final, nagging problem is a dispute settlement system to underpin the entire post-Brexit agreement. After the British government’s announcement that it was ready to violate the Brexit withdrawal treaty, EU officials have said a solid legal process to resolve future disputes was more important than ever. The UK is resisting the EU’s main demands on all these issues, despite signs Brussels is willing to compromise on state aid and fish. It remains unclear whether the two sides can find a middle way. As talks grind on, the European commission has begun legal action over the internal market bill, which includes clauses that override the withdrawal agreement the prime minister signed last year. The government has admitted the bill breaks international law but argues the UK needs a “safety net” to protect its internal market. For now, legal action and Brexit talks are on separate tracks. The EU hopes the prospect of a zero-tariff trade deal will allay lingering British concerns about the Irish protocol, leading the government to drop the offending provisions. But the UK has been put on notice that it cannot get a trade deal if its “loaded gun” remains on the table. “Let there be no mistake, there is no deal with any of these threats pending,” one EU official said. For now the task is political rather than technical. Both sides think a deal is in grasp if the other side climbs down. For the EU, the big question mark is whether Johnson wants a deal or will follow the lead of his close advisers Dominic Cummings and Frost, who are perceived in Brussels to be more comfortable with no deal. “My feeling is that he [Johnson] is not a real ideologue; it’s not impossible [to get a deal],” said one senior EU diplomat. But the task will soon become technical. While there are nearly three months before the transition period expires, the EU says the ultimate deadline is late October, although this could stretch into the first half of November. In the final six weeks of the year the 1,000-plus-page treaty – yet to be agreed – has to be finessed by lawyers, translated into all 24 EU languages, inspected by 27 EU governments (and some of their legislatures), then ratified by the UK and European parliaments. As finely balanced as the original Brexit vote itself: around 50/50. Big political choices are yet to be made – and the chances of the two sides arguing themselves out of time cannot be ruled out."
30,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/02/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-two-nations-employers-and-employees,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson's two nations  Employers and employees ,"Boris Johnson claims he is a “one nation Conservative”, bringing together the wealthy “classes” with the “masses”. Leaks from Downing Street signal a leftwing approach on economics and rightwing one on culture. Mr Johnson presents himself as the first Tory post-Thatcherite prime minister. His Brexit sales pitch was that he was prepared to sacrifice business profitability to regain “sovereignty”. Yet the Covid pandemic has shown Mr Johnson is unable to resolve the tension between his party’s free-market orthodoxy and a desire to cater to new working-class voters. Pre-crisis the British economy was characterised by low levels of business investment, a poor skills base, stagnating wages and the zombification of UK companies, which had taken on £1.2tn of corporate rated debt. Covid presented a chance to reset the economic model that has seen the share of wages fall as a share of the country’s gross domestic product. As providers of capital, investors might think that having a bigger share of economic output is a good thing. But companies also need customers who can afford to buy their goods and services. The question for Mr Johnson is whether demand in the economy should be profit-led or wage-led. His rhetoric suggests the latter while his policies advocate the former. The government’s Covid strategy is to save employers, not necessarily employees. The government has supported businesses with £50bn of state-backed coronavirus loans but done so without attaching any conditions about saving jobs. Since the government shamefully will not name who receives the state cash it is impossible to say which firms have benefited. If the Bank of England’s lending is any guide then the outlook for workers is bleak: Rolls-Royce took out a £300m emergency loan from the central bank and announced 3,000 job losses. The taxpayer is estimated to be on the hook for at least £23bn worth of losses. In the last seven days it has emerged that UK companies owned by private equity firms will be able to access emergency state-backed loan schemes. Private equity specialises in borrowing huge sums to buy firms after they have been refused loans by the banks. Once in charge the investors can increase “profitability” by sacking staff and selling off the company’s assets. The pandemic will lay waste to many corporates. Guildhawk, a leading software translations company, cautioned the government in March that “vulture funds” will use the crisis to “acquire, asset-strip and neutralise good companies”. Its warnings fell on deaf ears. While owners of capital are bailed out, support for workers has been withdrawn. Rather than extend the furlough scheme, like Germany and France, in the UK only “viable” jobs (those that can be done part-time) will receive state help. Tony Wilson of the Institute for Employment Studies warned those most likely to miss out “will be people with less secure contracts, shorter service (often younger workers), the lower paid and those in non-unionised workplaces”. The result is that UK unemployment will rise by a million by the end of the year. The economy will contract. People on universal credit, a meagre support in OECD comparisons, cannot consume much.  Conservatives are wary about government intervention but the state ought to help employees and employers stay afloat. Red wall voters who lent Mr Johnson their support won’t be happy if the economy falls over because he followed his party and let unemployment surge. There is a double whammy. Mr Johnson’s new support is in areas dominated by low-skilled and manufacturing employment. Coronavirus has hit them hard: they have unusually high levels of furloughed workers. Brexit would hit them harder. Mr Johnson could emulate Australia’s rightwing government, which says it will drop “debt and deficit” rhetoric to prioritise job creation. But the country needs deeds, not just words."
32,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/02/digested-week-boris-johnson-adult-learning-drive-back-to-90s,"  


  Digested week: Johnson's adult learning drive takes me back to the 90s ","David Nicholls is one of those authors that critics sometimes seem to underrate. Possibly because his novels always spend a long time on the bestseller lists. He doesn’t just have a sharp eye for story, his characters also have real depth and his books are a delicate balance between warmth and edge. No one ever gets too easy a ride. Us, which Nicholls has adapted into a Sunday night TV series – we’ve already binge watched all four episodes on iPlayer – is no exception. I can’t be the only bloke who saw the first five minutes and went into a cold sweat, wondering whether my wife was planning to tell me that our marriage was over because she now found me just a bit too dull and predictable. Before the coronavirus, my wife and I were both out at work during the week and had more of a social life at weekends, so I like to imagine that I may have appeared rather more interesting than I really am. Since March though, my wife and I have both been working from home and I can’t help feeling she must have noticed how boring I am because I do pretty much the same things every day. She did make a point of asking me during the second episode what big trip – other than a visit to Minneapolis to see our daughter – I would like to make before I died. My mind initially went blank, before hastily coming up with a ceramics tour of Japan. I think that was a good enough answer, so I may have earned myself a temporary reprieve. The other thing that has struck me about watching Us is how, even though it was filmed only last year, it seems like a different world with people taking travel and touch as normal. I wonder how soon it will be before we take them both for granted again when the pandemic is over. Back in the 1990s and the early years of the 2000s I worked on the Guardian as a writer for the regular Tuesday education supplement, which – pre-internet – had about 17 pages of features and interviews along with dozens of pages of advertisements for jobs in the education sector. We were a great team and would regularly cover all aspects of education from schools to universities and further education colleges. Inevitably, over the years, the same stories would come round time and time again, one of which would be some minister deciding that the government needed to do more for those who left school with few academic qualifications and to promote parity of esteem between universities and vocational training. At one point the education department took it so seriously that it renamed itself the Department for Education and Skills, and I have lost count of the number of articles I wrote that involved going to an adult training college to watch a minister try his hand at bricklaying or plumbing before making a speech about giving the country the skills it needed to compete with other countries. That would generally be the last we heard about a levelling-up agenda until the next time. It was the uncontentious go-to policy for any government short of ideas. So when Boris Johnson went down to Exeter College today to lay a few bricks, make precisely the same speech and to reannounce the same money that had already been earmarked for the training budget, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of deja vu. Given that he couldn’t even remember his own rules for the coronavirus restrictions, I’d be astonished if his promises on adult learning lasted longer than the time it took him to get back to London. There again, if he does genuinely make even a small difference to vocational training, he will be the first minister to have done so in over 30 years. Shortly after the end of the game between Liverpool and Arsenal on Monday night, the former Manchester United player-turned-pundit, Roy Keane got into an argument with Liverpool’s manager, Jurgen Klopp. It all seemed a bit academic as Liverpool had won 3-1 in relative comfort, but Keane was upset that Klopp’s side didn’t play more cautiously to hold on to its lead rather than continue to press for more goals. Writing as a Spurs fan, whose team has only won two league cups in the past 30 years, I may not be the best person to judge who is right but I’d still take Klopp’s style over Keane’s any time. In all the years my team has won next to nothing, I’ve enjoyed the Harry Redknapp and the Mauricio Pochettino years the best. These were sides that continued to press throughout the 90 minutes and even when it all went horribly wrong, I could still forgive them for attempting to play with panache. When we beat Southampton 5-2 the other week, I couldn’t help thinking that our current manager, José Mourinho, would rather we had seen the game out 2-0. When we were 1-0 up against Newcastle at the weekend deep into injury time, I had this feeling we were going to concede. Even if it was to an absurd penalty call. Still, at least this time I didn’t make the mistake of watching it. We were out to lunch and though I had brought my iPad with me, I didn’t switch it on. In these stressful Covid times, I’ve got to do everything possible to nurse my mental health. Starting with Spurs. Still, as we’ve just beaten Chelsea in a penalty shoot-out – I’ve lost count of the number I’ve seen us lose – I can feel myself unexpectedly warming to Mourinho. I am that fickle. I’d always fondly imagined Tom Stoppard’s life to be impossibly glamorous. Long lunches and stimulating conversation with famous people interspersed with a few hours work knocking out some bons mots for yet another critically successful play. However, Hermione Lee’s new biography reveals a rather more three-dimensional portrait. Because in between writing such plays as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Arcadia and Leopoldstadt, Stoppard has made a very nice living – up to $100,000 a week – working anonymously on such films as Beethoven (the mutt not the composer), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and the Bourne Ultimatum. He even wrote the immortal line in 102 Dalmatians, “You may have won the battle but I’m about to win the wardrobe.” Lee writes that Stoppard took on these screen-writing gigs purely for the cash: apparently having three wives and several long-term affairs is ruinously expensive. After all, who doesn’t need a Provençale bolt-hole to meet with a lover? But it wasn’t so much the money that got to me – though I must confess to a certain amount of envy and would like it on record that my daily rate is considerably less than Tom’s – it was the energy. Just how has Stoppard managed to cram so much into his life? My day begins with one ear open for a minister saying something stupid on the radio and continues in pretty much the same vein: looking for some piece of political nonsense or hypocrisy to turn into an 800-word sketch. And by the time I’ve done that, I’m pretty much knackered and haven’t the brain power to work on side projects. Which is something of an issue at the moment, as I am under contract to write two books. I keep telling myself I will have more headspace when the pandemic is over. I just hope I’m right. Woke up this morning to find out that both Donald Trump and Melania have tested positive for the coronavirus. After an initial WTF reaction, my next thought was how many of his supporters will think this is fake news or a plot to derail the US election. That’s how weird the news cycle has become. Normally at this time of year I am off to Birmingham, Bournemouth, Brighton, Liverpool or Manchester for the annual party conferences, but for obvious reasons they have all been cancelled and put online where most people – reporters included – have mostly ignored them. This weekend was meant to be the start of the Tory party conference and even though there will be nobody attending and Boris Johnson will presumably be delivering his speech in a near-empty room, I have still had to be security cleared to get access to the event. I can only assume the Conservative party knows something about my cyber hacking skills that I don’t. It’s hard to believe that Johnson’s speech will outdo the one in which Theresa May was presented with her P45, lost her voice and had the set collapse around her for drama, but harder still to know what he can say to the Tory faithful that will cheer them up. There may be a few who think that sending asylum seekers to Ascension Island, building a wave machine in the channel to repel small boats is what they voted for or putting Chris Grayling in charge of some decommissioned ferries is the answer to the country’s immigration problems, but most will have just thought that Dominic Cummings has been organising psychedelic brainstorming away days. Nor will Boris have anything positive to say about the coronavirus: as a pilot for Operation Moonshot – the government’s plan to do 10m saliva tests a day – all Salford residents were expected to have been tested by now, but the Manchester Evening News reports that the trial has not even reached 250 people a day. Maybe he’s got better news on Brexit and the economy. On second thoughts ... Digested week: Where to start? "

  The worst part of Trump paying zero taxes? It's probably entirely legal ","Donald Trump’s tax returns are a stark illustration of what’s broken with the US tax system: the tax code has one set of rules for the richest 0.1% and another for everyone else. For the vast majority of taxpayers, the rules are straightforward. If you earn a paycheck from an employer, odds are the majority of your taxes are already withheld, and your earnings are reported to the government. There’s little room for manipulation. But the wealthier you are, the more of your money likely comes from non-wage income, business ownership interests and other complex assets – and the easier it is to game the system. Many of these income sources are already taxed at lower rates than regular wages. But the richest 0.1% also hire “wealth defense industry” professionals – tax lawyers, accountants, wealth planners – who mine the tax code for loopholes and shift assets to the shadows. As a result, the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest US families fell below 25% over the last decade. That’s less than most low- and middle-income people pay already. But even in this supremely privileged club, Trump’s tax avoidance stands out. With a series of tax bills ranging from $0 to just $750 of his alleged billions, Trump paid virtually 0% most years. How? In part, Trump aggressively used business tax deductions and charitable donations. For instance, Trump “carried forward” losses from money-losing businesses from one year to the next, allowing him to claim the loss in multiple years. As a result, he paid no taxes in 10 out of 15 years between 2000 and 2015. On top of this, he deducted lavish lifestyle perks like private jets, luxury residences and $70,000 in hair styling as “business expenses.” Trump also paid tax-deductible salaries and consulting fees to his children, a form of passing on wealth that avoids estate and gift taxes. In fact, it’s the same technique Trump’s father used decades earlier to transfer $413m to Donald Trump himself. Trump even found a way to deploy charitable tax deductions in a self-interested manner. By donating development rights surrounding his personal mansion in Westchester county, New York to a land conservancy, Trump created a taxpayer-subsidized buffer zone around his private property while collecting a $21.1m charity tax break. Trump donated conservation easements in three other cases, including land around the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles. These transactions accounted for the vast majority of his charity deductions over these years. The attorney general of New York is investigating several of these transactions that may have deployed inflated appraisals. Abuses like these make it all too clear: lawmakers need to restore the integrity of the tax code, with a focus on the manipulations of top 0.1 percenters like Trump. For example, there should be a time limit and financial cap on how much taxpayers should subsidize failing business ventures. Limiting the carry-forward of legitimate losses to six years is a reasonable period for viable enterprises. Similarly, there should be stricter scrutiny of deductions for excessive personal luxury expenditures as qualified business expenses – $70,000 on haircuts shouldn’t make the cut. More fundamentally, Congress should eliminate the preferential treatment of income from capital over income from wages. There’s no reason stock gains, for example, should be taxed at a lower rate than workers’ paychecks. An easy first step would be to levy a 10% surtax on all income over $2m, whether from wages or investments. This would raise $635bn over a decade from those with the greatest capacity to pay. Congress should also modernize rules governing charitable giving to eliminate the provisions for the self-dealing so well chronicled in Trump’s donation of conservation easements that enhance his personal property. Congress should boost the IRS’s enforcement resources to close the estimated $574bn gap in lost annual revenue from tax evasion and noncompliance. Enforcement should focus on the richest 1%, who are responsible for roughly 70% of tax underreporting, according to one study. Investments in new technology and enforcement could bring in $24 in revenue for every $1 invested. If the laser focus is on the richest 0.1% of households and cracking down on many of the devices deployed by Trump, the potential benefits could be even greater. Then, Congress could turn its attention to further restoring progressivity to the federal tax system, legislating an annual wealth tax, strengthening the estate tax, and equalizing capital gains and income tax rates. The integrity of the US tax system has hit a new low, with the revelations that a sitting president is tax-avoider-in-chief. The Trump tax playbook should serve as a catalyst for reform.

36,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/02/big-break-for-dominic-thiem-as-stan-wawrinka-loses-to-hugo-gaston,French Open  Big break for Thiem as Wawrinka loses to Gaston ,"If life wasn’t meant to be easy, it surely has done Dominic Thiem few favours in the first week of the 2020 French Open, as he has elbowed his way past two belligerent opponents,knowing he has still probably got to beat Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic to win the title. On Friday, however, Thiem finally got a break. As Parisians braced themselves for the threatened closure of their bars and restaurants to guard against another surge of coronavirus, it was a good day to be indoors at Roland Garros, where the determined Austrian secured a third solid win to reach the first weekend. Robbed of time to luxuriate in his US Open triumph of a few weeks ago because of the rearranged calendar, the third seed beat the in-form Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier. It was more difficult than the scoreline suggests and followed tricky three-setters against the 2014 US champion and Wimbledon and Australian finalist, Marin Cilic (twice a quarter-finalist in Paris), and the stubborn American Jack Sock. Then, after he had finished, a twist nobody had envisaged: Thiem left court unaware that the 2018 champion, Stan Wawrinka – his supposed next opponent – was about to engage in a rain-interrupted dogfight on uncovered Suzanne-Lenglen with Hugo Gaston, France’s last man standing – at 5ft 8in. If he switched on his hotel TV around dinner time, he would learn that the world No 239 had beaten the Swiss 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0, the biggest shock of the tournament by a distance. The 20-year-old left-hander from Toulouse, who few outside the fringes of the game had heard of before he was handed a wildcard, showed extraordinary court presence in his third Tour-level tournament to overwhelm a three-slam champion who, on Sunday, inflicted a heavy defeat on Andy Murray. Gaston – winless in Challengers since the sport resumed in August – was magnificent, anticipating Wawrinka at every turn, tormenting him with the best drop shots of the week and refusing to bend to his power. When he forced a weary baseline forehand from Wawrinka after three hours and 10 minutes that did not reach the net, the small gathering of fans embarked on a frenzy of celebration. Gaston said: “This is a dream. Absolutely incredible. I just tried to play my game and, somehow, I won. Everything went well – thanks to these guys [pointing to the restricted crowd]. In two days’ time, I’m playing Thiem and I’ve got nothing to lose.” On the face of it, Thiem should welcome Wawrinka’s absence, but then, who can be sure? Little has been normal about this tournament, switched from spring to autumn to dodge the virus (and not totally managing that). “He was playing well from beginning to the end,” Thiem said. “I really raised my level. Maybe the first four games were not as good as the rest of the match by me, but he’s a really good player, especially on clay, probably one of the best of the season. If we give him one more year, then he’s going to be super dangerous.” Ruud was the better player for stretches of the first set, yet he lost it. The iniquity of it would play on his mind. When the chair umpire, Emanuel Joseph, got a line call wrong that cost Ruud a point and his serve at the start of the second, the Norwegian struggled to contain his indignation and he hit the familiar low-water mark of the aggrieved pro when he made a passing inquiry of the official: “Did you ever play tennis?”  No amount of residual dudgeon could lift Ruud as Thiem found a rhythm with the sort of heavy, precise ball-striking that won him the US Open. Few players on the Tour are physically – or mentally – stronger than Thiem. And this is his hunting ground. “I think that the wet, slow conditions suited me a little bit more than him,” he said. “But in general I was super happy with my performance. I think it was one of the best this year.” The shadows from the indoor lights were sharper by the time Nadal beat the unseeded Italian Stefano Travaglia 6-1, 6-4, 6-0, in an hour and 35 minutes. The Spaniard is fully restored to championship form on a court where he has won 12 titles in 15 visits. But for once, he did not make the main act."
37,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/02/gemma-davies-there-hasnt-been-a-moment-when-i-didnt-want-to-coach,"Aston Villa's Gemma Davies  


  There hasn't been a moment I didn't want to coach ","Gemma Davies is so unused to life in the slow lane that the process of buying her first house has opened a window to an alien new world where things move at sometimes glacial pace. “It’s been slow progress but I think we’re finally trying to set a completion date now,” Aston Villa’s 28‑year‑old manager says with a sigh. “I’m looking forward to moving in and getting on with the decorating.” The youngest head coach in the Women’s Super League is most definitely not the type to put things off until tomorrow. In little more than two years in charge, Davies has led Villa into the top tier for the first time in their history while also securing her A coaching licence. As she chats, via Zoom, from the gym at the Bodymoor Heath training complex Villa share with Dean Smith’s men, she initially looks far too youthful to be a manager but appearances can be hugely deceptive. It quickly becomes apparent that she speaks with the poise, maturity and authority of a woman obsessed with honing her craft since picking up a whistle almost by chance 13 years ago. Male peers know better than to patronise her. “I started coaching at 15, at a local grassroots club called Erdington Ladies, 10 minutes on the bus from our home in Birmingham,” she says. “It was more of a favour, if I’m honest. My sister played there and I’d go and watch. One summer holiday they were looking for coaches for the under‑12s and under‑10s and the chairman asked me to help out. “That six weeks has turned into a lifetime. I loved every minute. There hasn’t ever been a moment since when I didn’t want to coach.” Along the way she would turn a hobby into a profession but making an undoubted talent pay took time, sacrifice and emotional bravery. “To be a full-time, professional football coach was always a massive ambition, a dream,” says Davies, who until four months ago was also head of women’s football at Birmingham University. “To not be doing two jobs any more is a novelty which hasn’t quite worn off.” Reaching the point where she will lead out her team against upwardly mobile Everton in front of live television cameras on Saturday has involved Davies holding both her nerve and some awkward conversations. “Without the financial support of my parents and grandparents I’d never have been able to do it,” she says. “Until now, I’ve never really had a stable income but I was able to live rent free at home and when my car broke down or I needed a new pair of boots they helped. My family have been wonderful – although we definitely had conversations about ‘getting a proper job’. We’ve had those ‘are we getting to the point where you maybe need to consider a slightly more stable income’ talks. But we’re OK now!” After giving up playing at 19, Davies gained a “mind-broadening” MA in sports science from Loughborough University but proved an atypical student. “I’ve had to sacrifice a fair amount of nights out,” she says. “I’m surprised I still have friends but, fortunately, they’re very patient, very supportive.” At work, she is bolstered by Villa’s sporting director, Eni Aluko. “I like to be out on the grass so someone of Eni’s calibre, with her experience and contacts, has a large commercial and strategic remit; she supports me with player recruitment, with signings like Anita Asante.” Now 35, Asante is not only seven years her manager’s senior but has defended at the highest level in England, Sweden and the United States. “It’s a real privilege to work alongside Neetz,” says Davies. “As a kid, I watched her play for England. Neetz supports me and we pick each other’s brains – but my age isn’t an issue.” Even so, eyebrows were raised when her Villa tenure began with a 12-0 second-tier thrashing by Manchester United at the outset of a six-game winless run. “It was a stark awakening,” she admits. “A tough start but it’s definitely shaped me.” By the time Villa cantered to promotion last season they were fully integrated with the men’s setup and Davies’s career was back on fast forward. “We train next to the men’s under-23s,” she says. “It really is a one-club approach. There’s a lot of crossover, a lot of shared facilities and medical support.” That impressive infrastructure could prove vital in a WSL suddenly awash with high-profile overseas imports. “The bar’s definitely been raised, the quality’s fantastic,” says Davies as she seeks her first WSL points at Everton’s expense. “We know it’s going to take time to establish ourselves but we have trust and belief. Our future’s bright.”"
38,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/02/bath-hope-joe-cokanasiga-return-will-inspire-giant-step-towards-play-offs,"  


  Bath hope Cokanasiga return will inspire giant step towards play-offs ","On paper the big story this weekend is whether Bath can hang tough at Saracens on Sunday and make the Premiership play‑offs, potentially at the expense of Bristol or Sale. In Joe Cokanasiga’s case, however, the twin imposters of sporting triumph and disaster are exactly that. After everything big Joe has endured this past year, the vicissitudes of professional rugby are now strictly relative. Even the injured knee – and subsequent complications to his lower body and back after training on it with England – that sidelined him for the best part of 12 months has been nothing compared to the family trauma the Cokanasiga clan have been enduring. As the Guardian revealed in March, the government is refusing to allow the winger’s father, Iliatia, a former sergeant who served three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, to rejoin his family in the UK. It is a situation which continues to shame all those responsible for his plight. As of this week Iliatia, who spent almost 14 years with the British army, is still in Fiji, separated from his wife and children. Cokanasiga has spoken of his anger at the situation but, as yet, nothing has changed. “We are still fighting that battle,” his son says softly. “There’s nothing we can really do, it’s out of our control.” It can only be hoped that whatever is left of British fairness and decency eventually prevails. How wonderful it would be, therefore, if the 6ft 4in, 18-stone Cokanasiga could roar back and claim the England starting place that was within his grasp when he flew to the Rugby World Cup in Japan. The last time he represented England, a year ago this week, he scored two tries against USA in Kobe. It was his last competitive game until the comeback win for Bath against Gloucester last week. The sight of Cokanasiga coming off the bench to set up Ben Spencer for a match-clinching try at the Rec was a reminder of how much club and country have missed him. Simply making it back on to the field has been a test of character. During the World Cup the 22‑year‑old cut an increasingly downcast figure, suffering from a knee tendon injury that Bath felt could have been better managed. Finally, after rehab failed to heal it properly, he had an operation in Sweden before commencing the painstaking process of rebuilding his body and soul. “There were definitely times, some dark times, when I thought I wouldn’t make it this season,” he says now. “But credit to the medical team, my family and my girlfriend, who was my part-time psychologist. She kept me sane. Lockdown was a blessing for me, it gave me time. I feel like a completely different player and person now, mentally and physically.” Working with the psychologist Don McPherson, who helped Andrew Watson bounce back from long-term achilles tendon problems, also helped to bolster his confidence. Even so, keeping his emotions in check before his return against Gloucester was difficult. “I didn’t want to let the emotion take over me. It’s been a long journey and I was a bit nervous. My mum was devastated she couldn’t see my first game back [after the government ruled out spectators being present] but I felt their presence. I just tried to stay calm and make an impact.” Bath will be hoping he can continue to do so in the coming weeks. At his best, with the ball clutched in one giant paw, Cokanasiga offers something different from any other England‑qualified winger. The bad news for defenders is he is committed to improving further. “I came in a little bit overweight but we’ve turned that into good weight. Physically – and most importantly mentally – this is the best I’ve felt.” With Bath third entering the final round one point ahead of Sale and Bristol, a victory against Saracens will be enough to propel them into the semi-finals. They have secured seven wins in eight games since the Premiership season resumed in August and Cokanasiga has detected a significant change in mood. “There’s more belief. You can tell when you’re in camp there’s something different.” Bath’s director of rugby, Stuart Hooper, is anxious not to heap unnecessary pressure on his returning giant but accepts the club and England have at their disposal a rare talent: “The great thing with Joe is he’s obviously box office.” All that remains is for him to concentrate on the things he can control. “The focus is on doing as best as we can for Bath and hopefully getting that final spot,” he says. “If England come, playing for them has always been a thing for me.” If anybody deserves an upturn in fortune this winter it is the Cokanasiga family, young and old."
39,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/02/premier-league-clubs-ready-to-provide-funds-for-championship-clubs,Premier League  Clubs ready to provide funds for those in Football League ,"Premier League clubs have accepted they will have to offer financial assistance to the Football League as they prepare for a key meeting after the international break. After months of resistance, when the Premier League consistently argued the pandemic affected their ability to support the football pyramid beyond current obligations, there is now a recognition something more must be done. Discussions over the terms of any bailout – with the EFL asking for £250m – are yet to be resolved, however. The extent of any conditionality attached to a bailout is likely to be discussed at the next Premier League shareholders’ meeting, among a number of other issues. Clubs are set to vote on the number of games that must be played before a season can be curtailed, with an expectation they will agree on 75%. Another topic of discussion will be TV. On Friday the league published its televised fixtures for October, listing 15 games for broadcast. This is a change from the first four matchdays of the season, which followed the 2019-20 restart in broadcasting every match. At the meeting clubs are expected to be presented with a medium-term proposition over how many more matches should be shown while fans remain excluded from grounds. The Premier League remains frustrated by the government’s decision to suspend the return of fans. It is the bailout that is consuming the minds of club chairmen, however. Despite a summer of sustained transfer activity, with more than £1bn spent on players in the top flight, some top-flight clubs are enduring more straitened circumstances and there are those who see themselves as not dissimilar from clubs they are expected to bail out. Issues of transparency and accountability look set to be at the centre of any terms, with clubs afraid of giving ambitious competitors in the Championship a leg up. The introduction of a wage cap in the second tier could be insisted upon as a condition, although that would likely be contested strongly by Championship clubs who saw off a similar proposal in the summer. Other mooted conditions include an agreement on an expanded number of work permits available to foreign players after Brexit and more formal agreements between top-flight clubs and lower-league sides over the use of loan players. The National League has said its season will start as planned on Saturday after confirmation of “significant financial grant-aid support” from the government."
40,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/02/premiership-sale-16-covid-cases-rugby-union,Premiership rugby  Finale in chaos after Sale record 16 positive Covid cases ,"The Premiership’s grandstand finish has been plunged into chaos after 16 Sale players tested positive for Covid‑19. On Friday Sale insisted their crucial match against Worcester on Sunday will still go ahead but it is understood they are scrambling around for a squad and are asking players to come out of retirement to aid their cause. Premiership Rugby did not confirm on Friday night whether the match would go ahead but what had been shaping up as a grand finale with Sale one of four teams chasing three semi-final places has now been thrown into disarray. If the Sharks are unable to fulfil the fixture they would have to forfeit their match, handing the Warriors a 20-0 victory. Sale could argue they are not at fault and that they were given incorrect test results last week, which could have led to the outbreak. Sale are nonetheless confident that Sunday’s match can take place safely but questions will be raised given the extent of the outbreak in their squad and PRL will still need to give its approval. In France’s Top 14, three positive cases lead to an automatic cancellation of a match and on Thursday, Racing 92, who are due to face Exeter in the European Champions Cup on 17 October, revealed as many as nine employees had tested positive and their game on Saturday was cancelled. PRL has no such regulation. Having completed eight of the remaining nine rounds of the season since the restart, league organisers will be desperate for the Sunday’s fixtures to go ahead as planned but Sale have one of the smallest squads in the Premiership at 34 and fielding a thrown-together side against Worcester will again call into question the integrity of the competition. Sale are understandably desperate for the match to be played given they sit in fourth place, occupying the final playoff spot. A bonus-point victory over Worcester would guarantee them a semi-final place but Bristol, who are expected to win well at London Irish, would be poised to leapfrog the Sharks if the match at the AJ Bell stadium does not go ahead. Sale have said they will name their squad at midday on Saturday after PRL revealed on Friday that all team announcements were being delayed by 24 hours “following the recent set of midweek matches”. PRL will reveal the latest testing results on Saturday, having announced five positives, from three clubs, including four players and one official out of 1,056 players and club staff last week. After this week’s testing was carried out on Thursday, Sale were informed of the positive cases and all relevant personnel, as well as their close contacts, have been told to self-isolate. The Guardian understands Sale could make the case they were initially told they had no cases last week but they were subsequently informed that they did have positive tests. In the intervening period it is believed the squad took part in contact training. Forfeiting the match would be a hammer blow to Sale’s hopes of reaching the playoffs and would guarantee Wasps and Bath reach the semi-finals. It is understood the Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, spent Friday evening in talks with the authorities while the club reviewed its footage of training sessions to determine which players qualify as “close contacts” with those to have tested positive. Players who tested positive were also retested. The Sale outbreak comes four days after the Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, called for an end to the Premiership’s coronavirus testing system. Each round of testing costs an estimated £100,000, around £8,000 per club per week, and Baxter believes getting rid of the process would be an instant moneysaver for the cash-strapped clubs. “When you look at how few cases are being picked up I don’t think we are far off [having] genuine medical reasons to not continue with the testing,” said Baxter. “It would save a fortune and free up a block of testing for other people.”"
43,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/02/councils-given-five-minutes-notice-of-local-lockdown-confirmation,Exclusive  Councils given five minutes' notice of local lockdown confirmation ,"Council leaders in England were given five minutes’ notice of local lockdown rules being confirmed in their areas, according to emails seen by the Guardian. Amid growing calls for local authorities to have more control over restrictions, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is urging ministers to put councils “in the driver’s seat”. Hartlepool and Middlesbrough councils were only informed of the confirmed detail of the proposed restrictions when they received a draft press release from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at 10.25am on Thursday, five minutes before the measures were announced by Matt Hancock, leaked emails suggest. In Merseyside, where new rules were also announced on Thursday, it is understood that council bosses were briefed on the measures 30 minutes before Hancock’s statement. One senior source said they were surprised and concerned that the rules had been “watered down” from what had been discussed with a minister only 12 hours earlier. The restrictions are a significant extension to nationwide measures and make it illegal for households in the areas to mix in any indoor setting, including pubs, bars, restaurants and cinemas. The legislation will apply to nearly 5 million people across Merseyside, Warrington and most of north-east England from Saturday. The DHSC said discussions had taken place with local leaders over a number of days. Starmer called for change after a week of “massive frustration”, he said, from local authorities. “The message to the government is: involve local leaders, whether it’s council leaders or mayors, much more intensely, and much earlier. Because what’s going on is sometimes consultation, sometimes not.” Andy Preston, the Middlesbrough mayor, said there had been a “monstrous and frightening lack of communication” from the government, which had shown “disregard for local expertise, local knowledge and local need.” Earlier this week Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council, accused ministers of creating “chaos and confusion” by making significant announcements affecting millions of people without properly consulting local leaders. Local leaders say it is vital that they are closely involved in decisions, not least because they are often the first port of call for residents trying to understand new guidance. Emails show that a senior DHSC official wrote to Hartlepool and Middlesbrough councils on Wednesday evening to say Hancock wanted them to provide “written confirmation” that the leaders “have been engaged and understand the measures being proposed”. Hartlepool officials pushed back, saying it was not clear what measures were being proposed and they would not agree to restrictions “seemingly being proposed for us” that would make illegal any household mixing in pubs, bars and restaurants. It is understood that the council leaders were then left in the dark until they were sent a draft press release by a DHSC official at the same time that Hancock was announcing the new rules in the Commons on Thursday. Hartlepool officials demanded that the announcement be withdrawn pending further discussion. However, by that time the measures had been announced on live television. Requests for an urgent conference call with the health secretary were rebuffed as Hancock was still on his feet in the Commons. The leaders then expressed their anger in a call with Helen Whately, a junior health minister. The announcement also prompted frustration in Merseyside. The six local council leaders and Steve Rotheram, the mayor of Liverpool city region, had been in contact with DHSC ministers, officials and Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, all week but were left in the dark about the detail of the measures until just before they were announced. In contrast to Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, the Merseyside leaders were anxious for stricter measures than those proposed by the government. Infection rates in the region have surged since the beginning of September, with Liverpool and Knowsley recording the highest infection rates in England, at five times the national average. Merseyside officials have asked DHSC to urgently provide the scientific evidence behind the measures and to significantly increase financial support for the area. A DHSC spokesman said: “It is wrong to claim councils were only given short notice as in fact discussions and engagement had been taking place for several days. We understand how much of an imposition these measures are but they are based on the latest scientific evidence and are in place to suppress the virus, protect all of us while doing everything possible to support the economy.”"
44,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/02/asda-sold-to-billionaire-issa-brothers,Business  Asda sold to billionaire Issa brothers in £6.8bn deal ,"Asda has been sold to two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital in a deal that values the supermarket chain at £6.8bn. Asda, which was bought from the US retail giant Walmart, confirmed the sale to Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who made their fortunes building the EG Group petrol station empire, and TDR. In a joint statement, Mohsin and Zuber Issa said they were “very proud to be investing in Asda, an iconic British business that we have admired for many years”. Under the new ownership structure, the Issa brothers and TDR Capital will control Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain. Walmart is not exiting altogether and will retain a minority stake in the business and a seat on the board. The size of the buyers’ stakes and how much they paid for them has not been disclosed. The deal is being financed with £4bn of debt.  The £6.8bn price tag is only slightly more than the £6.7bn Walmart paid for Leeds-based Asda in 1999. Even with the US giant’s financial firepower behind it, Asda has struggled to come out on top in a ferociously competitive grocery market in which budget chains Aldi and Lidl have emerged as worthy adversaries. Mohsin said buying Asda was not “just a financial investment for us” with the company’s culture very similar to EG, “not to mention our shared northern values, being from just across the Pennines. The brothers bring a wealth of experience in convenience retail as well as brand partnerships, and KFC, Starbucks and Krispy Kreme are among the companies with which EG Group works. The businessmen leased their first petrol station in 1999 – the same year Walmart bought Asda – and today have more than 6,000 dotted across 10 countries. However, EG’s rapid expansion has been funded by loans, with last year’s accounts showing a debt pile of about £7bn. Asda is not being merged with EG, which the Issa brothers also co-own with TDR , and some analysts think this is to avoid receiving a red flag from the competition authorities. However, Asda has already started trialling a new convenience brand, Asda on the Move, in three of EG’s forecourts in the Midlands, with more expected to follow. Asda said it would continue to be based in Leeds and that Roger Burnley would remain as chief executive. The consortium has promised to invest £1bn in Asda over the next three years and to “maintain competitive pay levels” for staff. Neither side would comment on what the deal meant for the company’s long-running legal battle over equal pay, which has reached the supreme court. 1965 Asda comes into being when the entrepreneurial Asquith family, which started out with a chain of butcher’s shops in West Yorkshire, joined forces with the listed company Associated Dairies to launch a new business. 1989 George Davies, the founder of Next, is asked to produce a range of clothing for Asda. The George label blazed the trail for supermarket fashion and continues to be one of the UK’s biggest-selling clothing brands. 1991 Archie Norman, at the time regarded as one of Britain’s best young executives, takes charge of a struggling Asda. The share price has collapsed and he is the only person who applies to be chief executive of the retailer, which it is feared could go bust. 1999 Norman leads a successful turnaround with the help of Allan Leighton, another highly rated executive. The revival becomes the stuff of business school legend, sealed when US retail giant Walmart agrees to pay 220p a share for it (10 times its value when Norman took charge) after a bidding war with Kingfisher (owner of Woolworths and B&Q). The deal valued the chain at £6.7bn. 2005 Asda unveils plans to open a chain of discount food stores called Asda Essentials, but the plan is shelved the following year after the first two stores fail to deliver the expected results. 2010 Asda has a second crack at running small supermarkets, buying the Netto discount grocery chain for nearly £800m. However, the competition watchdog forces it to sell 25% of the stores. 2018 Sainsbury’s and Asda unveil a shock move to merge, creating Sasda, a group bigger than current market leader, Tesco. However, the deal is torpedoed after a year-long investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. 2020 Walmart says it is in talks to sell a majority stake in Asda but the process is derailed by coronavirus. It starts again over the summer, with a £6.8bn deal finally struck with petrol station billionaires Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital. At the time of the deal, the Leeds-headquartered company has 146,000 employees and 584 supermarkets and makes profits of £805m on annual sales of nearly £23bn. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said it was “great to see Asda returning to majority UK ownership for the first time in two decades”. However, the GMB union said the consortium needed to give Asda’s 146,000 staff some reassurance about their job security, given the uncertainty created by the sale process and last year’s pay row. Roger Jenkins, a GMB national officer, said: “They have had enough uncertainty and need to know that their futures are safe and secure.” Rob McWilliam, the Asda finance director, insisted the business had a bright future ahead of it. “This is about growth,” he said. “There is certainly no plan to close stores. We are looking to make Asda price more accessible to more people.”  Walmart will continue to share its buying power with Asda but over time access to the American company’s systems and technology will end. The move comes after Walmart’s first attempt to sell the company by merging Asda with its larger rival Sainsbury’s was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority. This new deal, however, will also require regulatory approval. Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said the deal created the “right ownership structure” for Asda. “I’m delighted that Walmart will retain a significant financial stake, a board seat and will continue as a strategic partner.” Asda made its name by offering customers everyday low prices (EDLP in industry jargon) which stood out at time when rivals used buy one, get one free and multi-buy promotions to convince shoppers they were getting a good deal. However, the battle with the discounters has forced all the big supermarkets to lower their prices, leaving Asda without a point of difference. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Asda’s recent sales performance had been “OK to lagging”, with profits falling sharply in recent years. “In the last decade Asda has underperformed the industry, it is the laggard of the big four superstores and is still behind the German discounters.” Walmart has wanted to quit Britain for some time, as fierce competition made it hard for Asda to make progress, Black said. “For Asda to be a market leader in the UK would require a lot more capital and price investment and I don’t think Walmart were up for the fight,” he added. “Has Asda been a great investment for Walmart? Absolutely not.”"

Windsor, perhaps best known for his role as DS John Watt in both Z-Cars and Softly, Softly, died at his home in London on Wednesday. Windsor acted for over five decades, with his first screen credit in 1955, but rose to prominence in the BBC police drama set in Newtown, a fictionalised version of Kirkby on Merseyside. Later in his career he appeared regularly in Casualty and Peak Practice, and his final credit was the 2004 film Between Two Women. A statement from his agent read: “Frank passed away peacefully at his home in London on Wednesday 30 September 2020. Born Frank W Higgins on 12 July 1928, his acting career spanned over 50 years, with notable roles in Z-Cars, Softly Softly, Casualty and Peak Practice. “Frank is survived by his daughter Amanda and his wife Mary, who was by his side until the end. As per Frank’s wishes and in keeping with Covid restrictions, there will be no funeral or memorial service, just a private cremation with his ashes being laid to rest with his beloved son David. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”"
49,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/oct/02/mps-call-for-stricter-safeguards-for-private-prosecutions,Law  MPs call for stricter safeguards for private prosecutions ,"Private prosecutions should be subject to more effective safeguards so that defendants receive a fair trial and do not pay excessive costs, MPs have recommended. Following the scandal over the Post Office’s misguided criminalisation of scores of its sub-postmasters, the justice select committee has warned of the danger where an “alleged victim in a case is also the investigator and the prosecutor”. Without central records, the report cautions, there is no way of confirming what it suspects is a sharp rise in prosecutions launched by individuals, companies and organisations such as the RSPCA. Legal aid costs, however, show that in 2014-15 a total of £360,000 was paid out of central funds for private prosecutions in 32 cases. By 2019-20 the costs had risen to nearly £12.3m in 276 cases. There are other financial temptations. Firms can pay less in court fees for private prosecutions than if they pursue civil claims, the committee heard. MPs say the increase of private prosecutions in England and Wales may well be a consequence of the “limited resources of both the Crown Prosecution Service and police”. The CPS was subject to swingeing cuts under austerity policies from 2010, although its resources have increased more recently. Although the CPS plays a key role in overseeing the right to bring private prosecutions, the report notes, “in practice it cannot be expected to be a regulator as well as a private prosecutor”. Among the report’s recommendations are that private prosecutions should be subjected to the same standards of accountability as public prosecutions. Organisations that frequently conduct private prosecutions should be regulated “to ensure they have the same evidential and legal standards as public prosecutors”. The committee also calls for: A central register of all private prosecutions. An enforceable code of standards for all private prosecutors and investigators. Privately prosecuted defendants to be informed of their right to a case review by the CPS. Those convicted not to pay more than they would have if convicted by public prosecutors. The CPS’s oversight role to be enhanced. Private prosecutions brought by the Post Office and the RSPCA suggest it is not sufficient to rely on the courts alone to identify and remedy problematic prosecutorial practices, the report says. “An increase in private prosecutions is likely to make that situation worse,” it adds. “Without effective oversight of the system as a whole, the government is going to struggle to identify any reforms that could make the overall prosecutorial system work more effectively and deliver better outcomes for the public and for access to justice.” The committee chair, the Conservative MP Sir Robert Neill, said: “The power to prosecute individuals, and potentially deprive them of their liberty, is an onerous power which must be treated with the utmost seriousness. “We’ve received evidence that the number of private prosecutions is increasing sharply. The overwhelming majority of private prosecutors uphold high standards. But the Post Office cases show the potential danger of the power to prosecute being misused.  “If the number of such cases continues to grow, the government will need to ensure that there are systems in place which make such private prosecutions comply with the highest possible standards.”"
50,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/02/rishi-sunak-uk-needs-to-protect-tech-secrets-from-foreign-investors,Technology  Rishi Sunak: UK needs to protect tech secrets from foreign investors ,"Britain needs new state aid rules in order to be able to protect itself against hostile states intent on stealing technological secrets and jobs, Rishi Sunak has said. The chancellor said the UK had benefited from foreign investment but the government had to keep its eyes wide open to possible threats. In a discussion on the professional networking platform Linkedin, Sunak did not mention any country by name, although a decision was taken in the summer to ban China from being involved in the development of Britain’s 5G network from 2027. “We have always been a country open to foreign investment and it has been very good for us,” the chancellor said. “It has driven up productivity and is part of what makes our economy dynamic. “But we really need to be eyes wide open because, sadly, in the world in which we’re living there are hostile state actors that come to invest and try to extract technology out of the UK, or indeed jobs,” he added. The UK’s determination to adopt a different state aid regime from that operating in the European Union has been a major sticking point in the trade talks between London and Brussels, and remains one of the key issues yet to be resolved. Sunak said it wasn’t his intention to use state aid to meddle with market forces. “I am cautious about the government’s ability to pick precise winners,” he said, adding that his aim was to create the environment where successful companies could thrive. Instead, the chancellor said the intention was to tighten rules and laws so that the UK could protect itself against those with hostile intentions. “This gives us the power to intervene if necessary,” he said. Sunak also made it clear that the high levels of spending and borrowing seen since the start of the Covid-19 crisis would have to end. “We have had to spend a lot this year and have had to borrow a lot to do that,” he said. “That was the right thing to do. The situation would have been a lot worse without it.” With the government’s budget deficit on course to exceed £300bn this year, Sunak said: “Obviously that level of support can’t go on for ever. Our public finances are important and I’ve been able to act in that way because we came into the crisis with strong public finances that enabled me to take the steps that I have.”"
51,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/health-officials-fear-de-prioritising-of-covid-testing-in-care-homes-in-england,Exclusive  Health officials fear de-prioritising of Covid testing in care homes in England ,"Covid-19 testing in care homes in England could be de-prioritised to save scarce laboratory capacity for the NHS, public health officials fear. The prioritisation of testing capacity to speed up results from hospitals has been raised in meetings between the NHS and local authorities, sources said. Delays in hospital testing are reportedly slowing down patient discharge and have caused some elective surgery to be postponed. “There are moves afoot to keep testing capacity for the NHS,” one local health official said after meetings with NHS colleagues. “It has been mooted in our area that the NHS has to come first and it is having real difficulties.” In an email seen by the Guardian, another senior local official urged colleagues to help head off a “concerning” proposal to prioritise NHS testing above care homes. They warned any reduction in care home testing could delay the identification of outbreaks. Concern about a potential move to switch test capacity away from care homes is said to have been raised by several local authorities in England. Dido Harding, the head of the NHS test-and-trace programme and the newly created National Institute for Health Protection, set out her testing priorities two weeks ago. She told MPs the first priority for testing was hospital patients, followed by care home workers, care home residents and then NHS staff. The Department of Health and Social Care denied any change was on the horizon. A spokesperson said: “There has been no change to our prioritisation of tests for care homes and there are no plans to change this in the future.” It said the government was issuing more than 120,000 tests a day to care homes, prioritising outbreak areas. However, concerns over the availability of testing in the NHS are growing. In a letter seen by the Guardian, one health authority warned that a shortage of reagent chemicals used to process tests meant some results were taking three days to come back in some hospital settings putting patient safety at risk. Jeremy Hunt, the Commons health select committee chairman, said on Thursday that community testing – the type relied on by care homes – should be deployed to support the NHS. “Some of those hospitals are trying really hard to test all their staff using their own laboratories, but to do that on a weekly basis they need support from NHS test and trace, they need additional reagents,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What we really need is for the government to say, ‘You need to make this happen at least in areas where there is high prevalence and we will help you if you can’t do it yourself’.” By the end of this month, the NHS is aiming to increase in-house testing capacity to 100,000 a day while NHS test and trace community testing is due to expand to 500,000 a day. In the week to 23 September, about 260,000 tests of all kinds were processed daily, latest figures show. Care homes have been clamouring for more rapid testing for staff who are supposed to be tested weekly, but in thousands of cases the results are taking more than a week to come back. This leaves residents at risk of infection by potentially asymptomatic care workers and means more care workers having to self-isolate unnecessarily. Portsmouth council this week complained it was not receiving a result for 30% of care home tests. The leader of the council, Gerald Vernon-Jackson, said it was an “impossible situation” for care managers. Such is the concern at the national system that Care England, which represents the care home chains providers, is trialling private testing with the potential to deliver results in 45 minutes from nostril swabs. The hope is that it could be used before staff begin their shifts and enable the return of family visitors. The devices are provided by VMD, a Leicester-based company, whose director, Anoop Maini, cautioned that trials were at an early stage. The machines, obtained from a Californian supplier, operate using a direct test of virus genetic material (RNA) similar to the PCR tests relied on by care homes, Maini said. He wants to make the equipment widely available this winter."
54,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/matteo-salvini-set-to-be-tried-over-migrant-kidnapping-charges-italy,Italy  Matteo Salvini goes on trial over migrant kidnapping charges ,"Italy’s far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini goes on trial on Saturday on kidnapping charges over an incident in 2019 when 116 migrants were prevented from disembarking a coastguard ship in the Mediterranean. Prosecutors in the Sicilian city of Catania accuse the League party leader of abusing his powers to block people from disembarking from the Gregoretti coastguard boat under his “closed ports” policy. The 47-year-old called on his supporters to descend on the courtroom in Catania to protest against what he has described as a plot against him. “I will plead guilty to defending Italy and the Italians,” Salvini told the press last week. Fellow far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, head of the Brothers of Italy party, has promised to attend the rally, while the ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who has faced several trials himself, will send a delegation from his Forza Italia party. Salvini’s fortunes have waned since he withdrew the League from its fractious governing alliance with the Five Star Movement (M5S) in August 2019 in an attempt to capitalise upon his high poll ratings and seize the prime ministership. His rallies are disrupted by protesters and people often challenge him in the streets. As well as having his judgment questioned by people in his own party, he is embroiled in a series of legal wrangles, the majority connected to his tenure as a hardline interior minister. One of Salvini’s first moves when he took office in June 2018 was to declare Italian ports closed to ships engaged in rescuing people fleeing Libya by boat. There were subsequently 25 standoffs between rescue vessels and Italian authorities, some of which became the focus of criminal investigations. The case coming before the court on Saturday relates to a group of migrants who were rescued in the Mediterranean in two separate operations on 25 June last year after five days at sea. There were 15 unaccompanied children among them. They were transferred to the Gregoretti on 26 July, then held on the overcrowded patrol vessel under a fierce summer sun – despite a scabies outbreak and a suspected case of tuberculosis. The unaccompanied children were allowed off on 29 July following pressure from Catania’s youth court. The remaining migrants disembarked 31 July after Salvini said a deal had been brokered with EU countries to take them. A few months later, the Catania prosecutor’s office placed Salvini under investigation and in February this year the Italian senate formally authorised criminal proceedings. His defence team insists the decision to hold the people on the ship was not Salvini’s alone, but reached collectively within the government. It will be up to a preliminary hearing judge to decide whether the case is strong enough to proceed with the trial. Observers say Salvini erred politically when he withdrew the League from government in August last year. He did not anticipate that the antiestablishment 5SM and centre-left Democratic party would put aside their deep enmity and go into coalition themselves, leaving the League on the opposition benches. “Once Salvini reached the peak of his rise, believing himself invincible, he lost his lucidity and made one mistake after another,” said Matteo Pucciarelli, a journalist at La Repubblica and author of a book about Salvini. “After kicking himself out of the government, he is now slowly losing the leadership of the right to Meloni.” Salvini’s attempts to keep his anti-migrant rhetoric front and centre in Italian politics this year, by linking the coronavirus pandemic to migrant arrivals, have failed to cut through. “The strategy to exploit migrants, citing they were threatening Italy by bringing Covid-19 with them, simply did not work,” said Pucciarelli. “Migrants were no longer at the top of the minds of Italians who have had more serious issues to think about during the pandemic.” Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Mercatorum University in Rome, said Salvini’s rhetoric around invading migrants infected with Covid-19 was not credible to Italians. “In addition, the management of the pandemic in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the coronavirus – and governed by the League - has been very controversial and characterised by numerous political errors,” Panarari said. “The fact that this region was governed by Salvini’s party has had a negative impact on its popularity.” Despite the setbacks, Salvini still has a strong support base and is expected to be able to rally thousands to his cause in Catania on Saturday. Asked recently whether he would prevent the disembarkation if he could go back in time, he replied: ‘‘It is not that I would do it again – I am going to do it again.”"
55,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/02/melania-trump-tapes-christmas-migrant-children-stephanie-winston-wolkoff,Melania Trump  Tapes reveal complaints on Christmas ,"Melania Trump had a rough night on Thursday, testing positive for coronavirus, like her husband, but also seeing the publication of a recorded conversation with a former friend in which she asked: “Who gives a fuck about Christmas?” The first lady also said the media should give her “a fucking break” over Donald Trump’s widely condemned child separations policy at the southern border. As James Comey once almost said – and Donald Trump might have repeated after Bob Woodward played their conversations to the nation – “Lordy, there are tapes.” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is the author of Melania & Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship With the First Lady, a tell-all about her relationship with and work for Trump which was published in August. Before release, it was reported that Wolkoff had taped her former friend. On Thursday, a little over a month from election day, she released such a recording to CNN. “They say I’m complicit,” Melania Trump says of critics of her husband. “I’m the same like him, I support him. I don’t say enough, I don’t do enough where I am. “I’m working ... my ass off on the Christmas stuff, that you know, who gives a fuck about the Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?” Media figures were quick to remark on the irony of the first lady questioning her role in decorating the White House for the festive season, given her husband’s eager promotion of the so-called “war on Christmas”, a rightwing saw much pushed on Fox News which says liberals want to take the joys of the holidays away. But the conversation with Wolkoff, recorded in summer 2018, also assumes a darker hue. “OK,” the first lady says, “and then I do it and I say that I’m working on Christmas and planning for the Christmas and they said, ‘Oh, what about the children that they were separated?’ Give me a fucking break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that? I cannot go, I was trying to get the kid reunited with the mom. I didn’t have a chance – [it] needs to go through the process and through the law.” The “zero tolerance” policy of separating migrant families caused huge controversy in 2018. Donald Trump backed down but the effects are still felt by many families. Saying Barack Obama did the same thing is a common rightwing talking point. Separations did happen under Obama, but not as a blanket policy and not at all after a judge intervened. On the tapes, the first lady also doubts claims migrants are held in poor conditions, saying: “The kids, they say, ‘Wow I will have my own bed? I will sleep on the bed? I will have a cabinet for my clothes?’ It’s so sad to hear it but they didn’t have that in their own countries, they sleep on the floor. “They are taken care of nicely there. But you know, yeah, they are not with parents, it’s sad. But when they come here alone or with coyotes [human traffickers] or illegally, you know, you need to do something.” She also says migrant children are coached by their parents to say they are in danger, because “they could easily stay in Mexico but they don’t want to stay in Mexico because Mexico doesn’t take care of them the same as America does”. In a statement, Stephanie Grisham, spokeswoman for the first lady, said: “Secretly taping the first lady and willfully breaking a [non-disclosure agreement] to publish a salacious book is a clear attempt at relevance. The timing of this continues to be suspect – as does this never-ending exercise in self-pity and narcissism.” Wolkoff, an events planner from New York high society, fell out with the first lady and left the White House amid investigations of fundraising for Trump’s inauguration. In February 2018, the New York Times reported that from $107m raised for the event, a company started by Wolkoff received nearly $26m. Wolkoff was paid $1.62m, the paper said, of which she banked $500,000. Wolkoff left the White House, according to the Times, because of fallout from its report including a government watchdog accusing the inaugural committee of “fiscal mismanagement at its worst”. In September, Wolkoff told MSNBC she made the tapes as a form of defense. “Melania and the White House had accused me of criminal activity and publicly shamed and fired me and made me their scapegoat. At that moment in time, that’s when I pressed record. She was no longer my friend and she was willing to let them take me down.”"
57,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/02/us-voting-electronic-lawsuit-voters-living-abroad,US elections  Voters living abroad sue for access to electronic voting ,"US voters living outside the country filed a class-action lawsuit this week against election officials in seven states to force them to let voters return completed ballots electronically. The voters cite current mail-processing delays with the US Postal Service, spurred by budget cuts and the pandemic, as the reason for their lawsuit, as well as curtailed mail services in the countries where they live. The voters, residing across Europe, as well as in Thailand, New Zealand, and Singapore, say election officials are abrogating their duties and denying eligible citizens their constitutional right to vote. About 3 million Americans of voting age were living abroad as of 2016, according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program. Wednesday’s complaint, lodged against election officials in Georgia, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin – among them, critical swing states – charges the officials with leaving overseas voters with “literally no… reliable way of voting” and calls on them to join 30 other states that currently allow overseas voters to return ballots electronically. The move, however, comes just months after the Department of Homeland Security issued guidelines to states warning them against allowing voters to return completed ballots electronically via fax, email or direct upload, calling it a “high risk” practice that could let malicious actors alter votes and vote totals “at scale” and compromise elections. The guidelines, prepared by the DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), were developed in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the FBI and other federal agencies, and followed similar warnings over the last two decades from the Department of Defense and the National Academies of Science, who concluded that there was no way to return ballots securely over the internet. “A last-minute change like this for something that is highly controversial to begin with is not a good idea,” says Larry Norden, director of the Election Reform Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which has worked to improve election administration for more than a decade. “It’s a general principle of election security that you don’t want to be making huge changes in the technology for how people vote right before an election and that’s certainly the case for submitting ballots over the internet.” Ballots sent electronically also can’t be audited since there is no paper backup of the digital documents that election officials can use to verify that the votes weren’t changed before or after the digital ballots were sent. “This lawsuit comes at a time when all election officials are completely overwhelmed by the logistics necessary for the general election,” said Doug Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections and a defendant in the lawsuit, in an email to the Guardian. “I will continue to oppose all methods of voting that do not provide for a voter verifiable paper audit trail as required by New York law.” In the states where electronic return is allowed, the Federal Voting Assistance Program, operated by the Department of Defense, offers a service for voters outside the US to email completed ballots to a FVAP email address. FVAP converts those ballots into an electronic fax that is forwarded to the appropriate state. Voters outside the US also have the option of returning their ballot via a paid courier service, diplomatic pouch through their local US embassy or – for military voters – via the military’s mail service. But courier services can be expensive and not all voters live close to a US embassy. A Thailand-based plaintiff in the lawsuit asserted that she returned her ballot via diplomatic pouch two weeks ago but has not received any confirmation. Another Germany-based voter who has used a ballot tracking service many states offer, asserted that he mailed it on 16 September and although it arrived in the US two days later, it sat in a New York mail sorting facility for eight days before moving to a Georgia facility, where it was still waiting to be sorted and sent to the Georgia Board of Elections on 30 September. Data on how many voters outside the US return ballots electronically is incomplete because not all states track or report this information. In 2016, states sent more than 930,000 absentee ballots to voters outside the country, and about 633,000 completed ballots were returned. There’s no comprehensive data indicating how many were returned electronically. Government accountability group Common Cause calculated that at least 100,000 ballots were returned via fax or the internet in 2016 in states that provided data. States are required to send absentee ballots to registered voters living outside the US, at least 45 days before federal elections. If voters don’t receive their ballots on time, they can download a blank federal write-in ballot from a Department of Defense website and fill in the names of the candidates they’re voting for. States differ, however, in how those completed ballots can be returned."
59,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/emmanuel-macron-outlines-law-islamic-separatism-france,France  Macron outlines new law to prevent Islamic 'separatism'  ,"Emmanuel Macron has announced a law against religious “separatism” aimed at freeing Islam in France from “foreign influences”. In a long-awaited declaration, the French president outlined new measures to “defend the republic and its values and ensure it respects its promises of equality and emancipation”. The measures to combat “radical Islamism” and terrorism suggested a carrot-and-stick approach: local officials will be given extra legal powers to combat extremism while money will be invested in education – particularly of Islamic culture and civilisation – and to deal with other social problems including housing and poverty. “Our challenge is to fight against those who go off the rails in the name of religion … while protecting those who believe in Islam and are full citizens of the republic,” Macron said. His speech on Friday was a broad outline of the measures to come, which he said would be drawn up in the next two weeks for a law to be presented in December. The measures include placing mosques under greater control and requiring that imams are trained and certified in France. The aim would be to “liberate French Islam from foreign influences”, he said, particularly funding. Islamic organisations that receive funding from the French state will have to sign a “secular charter”. Associations found to be pushing ideas contrary to republican ideals could be ordered to disband, and €10m (just over £9m) of public funds would be used to finance higher education studies and research into Islamic culture and civilisation. “The country has been hit by Islamic terrorism since 2012 and we have progressively rearmed against this threat,” he said. Radical Islamism had shown a “willingness to contravene the laws of the republic, to promote other values … to organise another society”.  However, he recognised that France’s colonial past had helped to create the problems the country faced. “We have created our own separatism in some of our areas. We have concentrated populations of the same origins, the same religion.” This had created “economic and educational difficulties”. Macron announced extra funding for the country’s education and justice ministries to “assure a republican presence in every road, every building”. He said education was key to the measures and that from September next year children would be required to attend school from the age of three. Home schooling is to be limited. Macron would be drawing up new measures in the coming weeks to address other social problems including housing, because a “profound change” was needed, he said. “We cannot keep adding poverty to poverty.” "
61,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/02/global-stock-markets-slide-after-trump-covid-diagnosis-ftse-100,Business  Trump's Covid diagnosis spooks investors but FTSE closes in the black ,"Markets in the US and Europe endured a day of volatile trading after Donald Trump’s positive test for Covid-19 shook investors. The S&P 500 index, the US equity market benchmark, fell by 1.6% in the opening trades on the New York Stock Exchange, but closed down just 0.96%. The Dow Jones lost 1.4% initially but also pared its losses to end the day down 0.48% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost 2.2%. Investors initially reacted badly to the Trump news but gained confidence as Washington appeared closer to reaching a deal on a fresh round of stimulus money. Every major stock market index in Europe fell in early morning trading, although by the afternoon many had recovered some of their losses, with the FTSE 100 in London closing up by 0.4%. Analysts said Trump’s diagnosis would heighten uncertainty in financial markets in the run-up to the election, scheduled for 3 November. Kit Juckes, the head of foreign exchange strategy at the French bank Société Générale, said there were “few immediate answers” to the uncertainties posed by the news, although he noted that the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, had a significant lead in most national polls. However, Juckes added: “The path of the election campaign will inevitably change and uncertainty has obviously increased.” The Trump news added to concerns about the economic outlook as new data showed that US job growth slowed more than expected in September. The US Labor Department said on Friday that non-farm payrolls increased by 661,000 last month, after the economy added 1.5m jobs in August. Economists were expecting an increase of 850,000. James Knightley, chief international economist at the investment bank ING, said the jobs figures showed the US economic recovery was losing momentum. “While employment continues to grow, the pace of gains is slowing, while government jobs are being lost,” he said. “It underlines the argument for additional fiscal support.” Oil prices were among the hardest hit on financial markets. Futures prices for Brent crude, the North Sea oil benchmark, fell by more than two dollars, or 5%, to less than $39 per barrel. The US West Texas Intermediate benchmark also lost as much as $2 to fall below $37. The prices of safe-haven assets rose in the immediate aftermath of the Trump announcement before retreating over the course of the day. Gold prices rallied in morning trading but fell back by 0.3% later in the day to trade at $1,900 per troy ounce. Investors bought government bonds, generally considered to be less risky than equities, after the news was announced. The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury bond fell from 0.684% to 0.653% before recovering to trade slightly higher over the day. Bond yields move inversely to prices, falling as demand rises. Derek Halpenny, the head of research at MUFG Bank, said the news would “diminish risk appetite” but added that it was unclear how it would ultimately affect financial markets, given differing views among investors on whether a Trump or Biden win would be more favourable for the US economy. Halpenny also noted that a possible delay to the election might add to the uncertainty. Mohit Kumar, an interest rate strategist at the US investment bank Jefferies, said Trump’s diagnosis and the failure of Republican and Democratic politicians to reach a breakthrough in negotiations meant a fresh stimulus package – a potential boost to stock markets – was unlikely until after the election result."

The tea-brown, silt-clouded water of the Mekong appears, gliding beneath the prow of a little boat. Lines from the great poet Rabindranath Tagore’s The Gardener lap the screen, concluding: “Why did the harp-string break? I tried to force a note that was beyond its power. That is why the harp-string is broken.” Becoming Alluvium is a lyric poem in moving images that echoes the mythic passion of Tagore’s verse, its varying rhythms and its themes of love, care and oneness with the natural world. At the heart of Phan’s short film is the Mekong River, the waterway flowing from Tibet through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia before meeting the sea in southern Vietnam. The Mekong is the broken harp string, the thread forced beyond its power. A mighty river that has sustained life for millennia, now polluted by pesticides, factory runoff and vehicle fumes; mined for sand and drained for irrigation; dammed and over-fished. Becoming Alluvium travels through three episodes or parables, linked by the Mekong and by the theme of reincarnation. Our guides through these stories are two boys drowned in the flood from a dam. One is reincarnated as a water hyacinth, the other as an Irrawaddy dolphin. Gliding downstream to an open expanse of water, with land barely visible on either side, the first “reincarnation” is the river seen through the eyes of a French woman of the colonial era. We hear Marguerite Duras in The Lover, on a ferry crossing in French Indochina, describing the climate, the boat, the surrounding voices with an exoticising European eye. We see the Mekong of today, providing electricity, transport, food and connection to the world beyond. The second reincarnation comes in the cycle of consumption and ejection, between the alluring excess of the marketplaces in cities along the Mekong and the mountains of waste that lie on the river’s banks. Beautiful dragons and turtles sculpted in fruit gape from a shrine-like display, families sit eating picnics out of plastic bags, kids play on the water in a giant inflatable ball: this is the river as site of leisure and entertainment. A passage from Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities describes the novelty-obsessed city of Leonia, in which citizens sleep nightly in fresh sheets and leave the goods of yesterday out in bags for the venerated rubbish collectors who transport them out of town: “So you begin to wonder if Leonia’s true passion is really, as they say, the enjoyment of new and different things, and not, instead, the joy of expelling, discarding, cleansing itself of a recurrent impurity.” The river has washed up plastic shoes and bags, scattering the banks with debris. A figure picks through a mountain of rubbish, searching for anything he can salvage. For the third reincarnation, Phan turns to animation: watercolour drawings over prints of 19th-century French explorers with mutton-chop whiskers and walrus moustaches. Phan’s painted characters have the grace of fairytale illustrations, but are headless. Between each episode in the story, the coloured drawings melt away to reveal a monochrome scene beneath. Engravings show European explorers and their aristocratic hosts reclining in splendour, attended by servants crawling on all fours: like the river itself, the people are the overlooked force powering everything along. Just as the harp string breaks when pushed to play an unreachable note, this fable tells of an impossible request: a princess who demands jewels made from monsoon dew. Her father orders jewellers to satisfy the princess’s request, on threat of beheading. Eventually a monk reveals the folly of her demand, and the shamed princess becomes one with the water of the Mekong. Of no more status than silt carried in the fast-moving river, as we too will someday be, she is becoming alluvium, the rich deposits of mud from which new life will spring. Phan’s film-making is elegant and unforced, drawing together strands from across cultures and times. Two painted works are installed in the gallery. In the first, a lacquered and silver-leafed frame standing on the floor carries six watercolour paintings on silk extending the environmental fables of the film – a boy caring for a beached Irrawaddy dolphin, young pioneers spraying insecticide. The other work, mounted on the wall, is a lacquered and gold-leafed tablet. What serves as the frame for one work becomes the picture in the other. There is no river separate from its banks. Thao Nguyen Phan: Becoming Alluvium is at Chisenhale Gallery, London, until 6 December."
73,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/02/why-radiohead-are-the-blackest-white-band-of-our-times,Radiohead  Why they are the Blackest white band of our times ,"Ask anyone who is the Blackest white rock band to emerge over the past 30 years, and my hunch is that few would say Radiohead. The hypnotically wonky Oxfordshire quintet are lauded for intricate, challenging music that is now far from their grunge-era breakthrough. Their rapturous second album (1995’s The Bends) yoked together symphonic alt-rock melodies with even bigger feelings, and their post-prog-rock masterpiece OK Computer (1997) delivered darkly ominous late 20th-century dread about everything from rising neoliberal alienation to the coldness of technology. It prompted stop you in your tracks superlatives from critics, who became even more rapturous for the follow-up, Kid A, released 20 years ago today. In sync with Black music, though? Immediately obvious contenders from that pop moment include funk rock veterans the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or perhaps – if reaching – the late 1990s rap-metal hybrid bands (Korn, Limp Bizkit) who gestured toward hip-hop rhyme schemes with little pretense toward virtuosic MC flow. But these examples miss the point entirely, emphasising superficial pop style rather than thinking more deeply about art that expresses the ideals and challenges of Black life. It might sound absurd if judging by their slightly awkward, extremely white appearance, but I have long heard a strange and beautiful Blackness in Radiohead. There are powerful resonances between their work and radical Black art, that are more meaningful than ever amid our current racial reckoning. Resistance, futurism and critiques of bald-faced power are hardwired into Radiohead’s sound, and this blend, along with their embrace of jazz and other revolutionary Black musical forms, is likely why a whole host of contemporary Black artists have covered their work. The Black era of Radiohead came fully to the fore on Kid A. It was famously polarising, with some longing for more guitars, others hailing the boldness of its sonic invention. The latter camp – including me – celebrated the band’s willingness to push even further past verse-chorus-verse rock towards adventurous dance and electronic music, and jazz avant-gardism, in individual song ideas as well as overall ethical vision. As the critic Simon Reynolds would have it, Kid A was a record that did the hard thing of capturing “the vivid colours, spatial weirdness and rhythmic compulsion” of electronic music while yet still summoning the feelings one associates with “surface-and-sensation oriented, collective high-inducing dance”. It was a record that struck out, as he argues, “in search of the remotest extremities of the rock tradition”. What makes Radiohead so radical are their deeply introspective other worlds, built as bulwarks against the tyrannies of everyday life In the year 2000, all I wanted, as a Black girl Radiohead fan, was to live with them out at these extremities. The woozy keyboard swirl and processed vocal gibberish of Everything in Its Right Place, the album’s opening track, announced the very opposite: all was about to be thrown thrillingly out of whack. The sublime Treefingers is a glimmering object that spins slowly around the universe; the spectacular plaintive sorrow of Motion Picture Soundtrack was an invitation to dive into a cinematic dreamscape of heartbreak. Why not live in these worlds, I thought, with the disaster of the US presidential election recount unfolding deep into the fall? What makes Radiohead’s music such a radical endeavour to me are these deeply introspective other worlds, built as bulwarks against the tyrannies of everyday life (a world where “we’ve got heads on sticks / you’ve got ventriloquists,” as Thom Yorke sings in nightmarishly garbled vocals on the title track). Kid A’s recurring lyrical insistence on “slipping away” is nothing new to rock masculinity, an anxious nod to the stubborn will to “not fade” dating back to the genre’s earliest days. But it is also a gorgeous, revolutionary invitation to exist in an elsewhere, in a way that resonates with what scholars often refer to as the Black Radical tradition in music. That tradition, which the philosopher and poet Fred Moten has written about extensively, reveals the ways that sound made by people who were once held captive, once deemed commodities, once defined as “not human”, is a vital form of self-making: it is the gateway to other lifeworlds to inhabit when no safe spaces are available. Black music, Moten argues, is “irruptive”, an “irreducibly disordering, deformational force” that has enabled colonised and disfranchised peoples to make a way out of no way. This tradition can be felt across the history of Black pop, in, for instance, the Afrofuturist aesthetics of Sun Ra and Funkadelic, and arguably even the materialist fantasies of rap. In the Black Lives Matter era, artists such as Solange, Frank Ocean, Childish Gambino, the Weeknd, Janelle Monáe and others have forged a kind of R&B that leans into weariness, psychedelic dreaming and longing as a confrontation and exorcism of our present day anti-Black terror. These latter musicians came of age in a 21st-century landscape transformed, in part, by Radiohead’s risk-taking activity at the fringes of pop. Kid A also aligned itself with jazz, the radical music before rock’n’roll that Black folks also birthed in response to the violence of Jim Crow life and the turbulence of mass migration. Those sounds come bursting forth on The National Anthem, with an eight-piece brass section invoking the spirit of the fearlessly way-out Art Ensemble of Chicago, as well as Charles Mingus’s 1964 Town Hall Concert, in which he called upon his ensemble to make noise akin to a traffic jam. Yorke sings through the cacophony: “Everyone around here / Everyone is so near / Everyone has got the fear / It’s holding on …” The body politic is fundamentally fraught, but this is the riotous music, this song tells us, that ferociously beats back against crisis. There are abundant think pieces and academic theses on Radiohead’s fluent conversations with jazz: the band’s guitarist Jonny Greenwood has cited Miles Davis’s fusion classic Bitches Brew as an important blueprint for OK Computer, and Mingus has had a continuing impact on their work, for instance on Pyramid Song from 2001’s Amnesiac. Black jazz artists, meanwhile, repay Radiohead’s respects with their own. Pianist and producer Robert Glasper’s multiple, stirring Radiohead covers – of tracks such as Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box and Reckoner – attest to the ways that their music travels in jazz musicians’ circles as topics of roving, improvisational exploration and abandon. Glasper’s crossfade reading of Everything in Its Right Place with Herbie Hancock’s Maiden Voyage connect Kid A’s escapist watery universe – awash in keyboard soundscapes that plunging you down and pull you to the surface of things – with Hancock’s rolling aquatic journey. But there are signs of Radiohead’s appeal to Black artists all around pop. Take the typically sly and unpredictable version of Creep that Prince dropped on a delighted Coachella audience in 2008, scrambling the pronouns of that self-loathing anthem (“What are we doing here? We don’t belong here!”). In Gnarls Barkley’s version of Reckoner (also circa ’08, at the dawn of the Obama era) Cee-Lo Green’s robust falsetto earnestly takes over Yorke’s dark songbird incantations about human division; Frank Ocean gave us an agonising and exquisite Fake Plastic Trees for one minute at a 2012 Spotify press conference. Risk-taking Black musicians keep turning to the band’s repertoire for its massive, formalist vistas, and for its expression of knotty feelings about the uncertainties of the world and one’s place in it. One of the most ambitious attempts at wedding the form and the feeling of Radiohead’s music with African American music is OK Lady, Roman GianArthur’s underground sensation of a mashup album from 2015. The singer-songwriter and member of Janelle Monáe’s marvellously audacious Wondaland Arts Collective looped together his own deep groove arrangements of tracks from OK Computer and The Bends with the dense songbook of D’Angelo, R&B’s prince of brooding funk abstractions, gospel hymnody and bedroom ballads. Standing at the crossroads of cosmic despair and iridescent hope, GianArthur’s succinct, elegant project turned up the volume on Black Radical music’s affinities with the band. Five years later, these affinities remain strong as ever for poet-singer Arlo Parks whose poignant, self-accompanied piano rendition of Creep stands out in a sea of similar interpretations by virtue of the 20-year-old Londoner’s delicately mature vocalising, and the way she transforms the song into a narrative of acutely queer heartbreak. And then there’s Lianne La Havas, whose self-titled third album released this year features a dramatically altered Weird Fishes, an underwater tale of love and fear from In Rainbows that circles back to themes of passion, submission, the anticipation of hitting the bottom of the sea of a relationship before finding an exit route. La Havas’s version slows things down to a march as she gets us to wade ever so carefully into the water with her; that big, shimmering vibrato of hers becomes “the deepest ocean,” the intoxicating alterity we all long for in this brutal era. Her cover whispers the possibility one also hears in the string arrangements of Radiohead tracks such as Dollars and Cents, which conjure the spiritually escapist sounds of jazz harpist Alice Coltrane (another touchstone figure for the band). This dreamy, mystic aura is the language of personal transfiguration and change, a way to “be constructive with your blues”, as Yorke puts it on that song. There are of course limits to the comparison. On the one hand, Kid A’s How to Disappear Completely feels to me as if it belongs on a wished-for soundtrack to Ralph Ellison’s still all-too-timely 1952 African American literary classic, Invisible Man. The song’s echoing refrain (“I’m not here / This isn’t happening”) sums up the agony of the novel’s unnamed narrator as well as his will to seize back the invisibility inflicted upon him by a white supremacist regime, and turn it into a shield and weapon. But Yorke’s challenges, we know, are not the same as Ellison’s hero. He chooses to be invisible in his reverie, as a reaction, perhaps, to his own struggles, which are worlds away from racial insult and injury. There are fathoms of Black experience that the band will simply never be able to access through their sound. Kid A’s biggest pop chorus, on Idioteque – “Here I’m allowed everything all of the time” – is a sarcastic condemnation of (white) privilege that has brought us to the edge of a climate crisis, but it’s a sentiment that may not chime with Black people, who aren’t allowed very much any of the time. Yet the connections between Black liberation and Radiohead’s creative freedom are still rich and were made undeniable when they did what no other stadium rock group has, to my knowledge, ever done, back in 2016 on their A Moon Shaped Pool tour. With the stage darkly lit at the start of each night’s gig, the voice of a Black woman musical genius, of Black feminist revolution, of a towering figure of activism and fortitude in popular music – that of Nina Simone – would signal the beginning of the show. Her words washed over us again at Madison Square Garden when I caught them on another leg of the tour in 2018: “What’s free to me? ... I’ve had a couple of times on stage when I’ve really felt free. And that’s something else! ... I tell you what freedom means to me. No fear. I mean really no fear.” I watched as the group took up their instruments under the cover of darkness and Nina’s words. There were no glaring lights, no raucous appeals to the crowd for welcoming applause, just the quiet resolve to pursue her charge, to live out the vision of her improvised aphorism. And, like the Black folks to my right and to my left – a smattering of peeps in the crowd, bespectacled young Afropunkers whose ardent anticipation was, like mine, palpable – I leapt out of my seat, ready to go with them to the free place of her dreams."
75,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/02/something-has-to-be-done-tackling-the-uks-black-maternal-health-problem,'Something has to be done'  Tackling the UK's Black maternal health problem ,"Tinuke Awe hadn’t been long at her midwife’s appointment when her pregnancy started spinning out of her control. Despite her body swelling uncomfortably as her baby grew, it was only at that 38-week checkup that pre-eclampsia was diagnosed. The midwife’s message was stark: go straight to the hospital, your life could be in danger. Once there she was given a vaginal pessary to induce labour, and told to expect nothing to happen for at least 24 hours. But a few hours later she was in agony. “I kept saying ‘I’m in pain, I’m in pain’, but I was completely dismissed and fobbed off – no one looked at me,” says Awe. Rushed into a treatment room when midwives finally discovered she was on the verge of giving birth, she found she was too exhausted to push and her son was delivered with the help of forceps. “I was just left feeling like I didn’t matter, that no one really cared about me,” she says. Her story is shocking but not uncommon. In the UK, Black women are five times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women, according to a 2019 report published by MBRRACE-UK. Black and minority ethnic groups are at greater risk of their baby dying in the womb or soon after birth, and at greater risk of severe long-term health problems. During the Covid-19 pandemic, 55% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus were from BAME backgrounds. This week the government has been put under mounting pressure to introduce targets to eradicate the disparity. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, asked Boris Johnson to commit to an inquiry into Black maternal mortality, describing the disparity as “truly shocking”. Friday sees the first meeting of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ (RCOG) race equality taskforce, and the launch of “five steps for healthcare professionals”, devised with Fivexmore, a campaign group set up by Awe and her co-campaigner Clotilde Rebecca Abe. “There are real people behind those statistics,” says Abe, who is also a co-chair of the St Thomas and Lambeth Maternity Voice Partnership and the creator of the social enterprise Prosperitys. “Something has to be done.” An increasingly vocal consensus that direct action must be taken is also growing in the medical community. In July Prof Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, England’s chief midwifery officer, explained to the parliamentary joint committee on human rights that a target had been set to provide continuity of care for 75% of BAME women. Asked if a target was needed to address mortality disparity, she said: “The short answer is absolutely, yes. One death where there is inequality because you are not on a level playing field is one death too many.” Why does the inequality exist? According to Dr Christine Ekechi, a co-chair of RCOG’s race equality taskforce and a consultant obstetrician gynaecologist, Black women are more likely to have conditions that can put them at greater risk, including cardiac disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, but this is far from the full picture. “The deeper question is: why are Black and Asian women more likely to have existing health conditions?” asks Ekechi. “There’s no specific gene that links all Asian people or a common gene that is found in all Black people. Many of these pre-existing conditions are non-communicable diseases which are driven by social determinants of health such as poverty, education and housing.” Research from the US shows that when Black and Asian women do not have pre-existing medical conditions, have English as their first language and come from middle-class backgrounds, they still have worse outcomes compared with white women from a similar background, she adds. “There’s something more that’s happening there.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said Dunkley-Bent was leading work to reduce health inequalities, while government-funded research at Oxford University was investigating the increased risk of women and babies of a BAME background dying. Introducing targets would indicate that the UK is determined to consign poor maternal health outcomes for Black women to history, says Ekechi. “What we don’t want is in the next reports to see that this disparity is widening.” Awe, an HR executive who set up the support group Mums and Tea in the wake of her own experience as well as co-founding Fivexmore, is determined to stop that happening. “In 1991 when my mum gave birth to me she was at greater risk of dying. In 2020 when I gave birth to my daughter that risk had increased and I was five times more likely to die,” she says. “I’ll be damned if my daughter, whenever she decides to give birth, is 25 times more likely to die.”"

I’ve never had a boyfriend or been kissed, let alone had sex. I’ve been on a few dates (they were uncomfortable) but they were more than 20 years ago. In the years since, nobody has asked me, and my fear has grown. I sought help from a therapist 15 years ago, but she made things worse by calling me childish, and telling me that I couldn’t be helped. Since then, I’ve been too ashamed to admit to anyone that I’m a virgin. How could they understand a woman who can’t find a man to want her? I’m not attractive, and men have never been interested in me. Now that I’m older, they don’t even see me as a woman.  I long for romance, but at the same time dread it. I’ve always hated being touched, and have found the idea of kissing disgusting for as long as I can remember. I do find men sexy and have been in love with a few, although they didn’t reciprocate my feelings. The thought of sex terrifies me. Maybe I’m asexual or have a phobia, but I’ve never had an opportunity to find out, and have long given up hope that I ever will. • Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.

84,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/02/hawaii-bristol-its-just-as-fun-worlds-top-adaptive-surfers-take-to-the-wave,"'Hawaii, Bristol, it's just as fun'  World's top adaptive surfers take to The Wave ","The rain pelted down and the wind swept in but Bruno Hansen, one of the world’s leading adaptive surfers, didn’t mind a bit. After his training session on The Wave surf lake on the outskirts of Bristol before a major competition on Saturday, Hansen summed up his mood in one word: exhilarated. “You arrive in the morning and it’s dark and cold and rainy,” said Hansen as he sipped a hot chocolate in the clubhouse. “You force yourself into the water. The first wave comes and everything changes. You’re pumped full of adrenaline, you start smiling. It doesn’t matter if you’re in perfect blue water in Hawaii or here in Bristol in the rain. It’s just as fun. Only a surfer knows the feeling.” Hansen, who was paralysed from the waist down in a carjacking in South Africa, is one of a couple of dozen leading surfers taking part in the English Adaptive Surfing Open. Now in its fourth year, the competition is going from strength to strength and, despite the Covid-19 crisis, surfers representing Portugal, Italy and the US are in Bristol to take part. Hansen is one of the sport’s leading lights. He ties his legs together using a bungee cord and lies prone on his board. Though he is based in Truro in Cornwall, he surfs under the flag of Denmark by dint of a Danish father. He speaks passionately about the power of surfing to help people cope with physical or mental issues. “I don’t care how depressed someone is, if they are paralysed, if they have one arm or two, but if you get out there into the waves, you smile. It’s just the way it is.” The event is a landmark one for Nick Hounsfield, the founder of The Wave and the chair of Surfing England. Getting down to a beach and into the water can be difficult for many people with disabilities. The Wave, which opened last year, was built with accessibility at the forefront. The quality and regularity of the waves – up to 1,000 an hour are churned out – makes it a user-friendly destination. “We designed The Wave with adaptive surfing at the very core of what we wanted to deliver,” he said. This weekend is also important for Surfing England as it builds a case to win more funding for the sport. The organisation is keen for adaptive surfing to follow its able-bodied equivalent into the Olympic movement. By the end of the decade it hopes adaptive surfing will be staged at the Paralympics. While Hansen is a veteran – he is about 50, and says he has stopped counting – many younger people are taking up the sport. As alternatives to lying prone on a board, some sit, kneel or stand. Londoner Tash Davies, 29, played wheelchair basketball before becoming a surfer. She first tried it out in Bournemouth and was hooked. “Once I’m in the water, I relax,” she said. “It’s the most inclusive sport. Everyone has different disabilities. You learn from each other.” Melissa Reid, 29, from Cornwall, who is partially sighted, won bronze in triathlon in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games. “I had a back injury but was told I could swim or surf,” she said of her sporting journey. So she paddled out into the Atlantic waves off Cornwall and fell in love with surfing. “It gave me a new lease of life. Surfers are the most accepting, happy group of people I’ve ever come across. It doesn’t matter who you are when you get into the water.” Reid has a guide who tells her when a wave is coming, how steep it is and if anyone is in the way. “Once I’m on the wave, I can’t see it. It’s all about feel,” she said. Reid offered a reminder that the event this weekend has a sharp edge. She has won two gold medals at the world para surfing championships. “I’ve entered three categories this weekend and the dream is to win them all. I’m extremely competitive.”"
85,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/canada-isis-killer-story-police-hoax,Canada  Did the 'Caliphate executioner' lie about his past as an Isis killer? ,"For months, unbeknown to his classmates and neighbours, a self-professed executioner was living freely in Canada’s largest city. But in 2018, his exploits were made public on a blockbuster podcast produced by the New York Times, in which the man who called himself Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi confessed to a string of grisly crimes as a member of the Islamic State’s religious police. The revelations prompted fear and outrage across Canada. Political rivals accused the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, of letting a “bloodthirsty” terrorist loose on the streets of Toronto. Recently, however, the story took an unexpected turn. When the Royal Canadian Mounted police finally laid charges last week against 25-year-old Shehroze Chaudhry – the man behind Abu Huzaifa – they weren’t for any crimes in Syria. Instead, he was charged under Canada’s hoax laws: police argued that his identity as a ruthless killer was a lie. The son of Pakistani immigrants, Chaudhry spent much of his youth in the city of Burlington in Ontario. After high school he travelled to Lahore for university. In 2014, at 17, Chaudhry is believed to have traveled on his Pakistani passport to Syria. When he returned to Canada in 2016, his posts praising Isis and referring to his time in Syria caught the attention of the New York Times reporter Rukmini Callimachi, who in a series of interviews drew out intimate and graphic details of his time with Isis. In one episode, Chaudhry described executing an alleged drug dealer. “The blood was – it was warm, and it sprayed everywhere,” he said. “I had to stab him multiple times. And then we put him up on a cross. And I had to leave the dagger in his heart.” He said he shot another man in the back of the head. The allegations quickly became a political embarrassment for the government, with opposition MPs demanding why a confessed murderer was apparently walking free. “Normally when people commit crimes in Canada, they do generally get arrested for them – especially when they confessed to them publicly,” said Jessica Davis, a former intelligence analyst for the Canadian government and head of Insight Threat Intelligence. “This was a highly unusual situation.” Chaudhry’s story also crystalized fears that – as the tide turned on the conflict in the Middle East – other Canadian citizens who had joined Isis and other extremist groups might return home. “The idea of fighters returning to Canada was still very abstract. The conflict was over in Syria and Iraq – it wasn’t in our backyard,” said Mubin Shaikh, a professor of public safety in Toronto and former counter-terrorism operative. “But [Abu Huzaifa] really brought it to the forefront … The story was sensational and had a fear factor.” Some analysts argue that the furore over Chaudhry undermined any serious discussion of de-radicalization in Canada – and effectively halted any government plans of repatriating other fighters. Among those fighters was Jack Letts, the British-Canadian Muslim convert who joined Isis and was eventually stripped of his British passport. Letts qualified for Canadian citizenship through his father, but the Trudeau government has shown no interest in aiding the 25-year-old, who remains in a Syrian prison. “To date, Canada has refused to return a single person from north-eastern Syria, not even a five-year-old orphan girl,” the Canadian researchers Leah West and Amarnath Amarasingam wrote in a recent article for Slate. “No other liberal democracy can match Canada’s abysmal record on this issue.” As the political row played out, key elements of Chaudhry’s story began to fray under sustained scrutiny, and he eventually denied murdering anyone. Instead, he claimed his previous statements to Callimachi were “childish” and based on the accounts of others. “You can put me through a polygraph and it will prove that I didn’t kill anyone,” he told the CBC last year. Even Shaikh, who worked with Chaudhry as a de-radicalization counsellor for more than a year, doubted his trustworthiness. “I didn’t know what he was hiding, but he was being deceptive,” he said. “We started to wonder – is this all bullshit? Is this just some fantastical story?” The New York Times initially said it “confirmed with multiple intelligence agencies” that Abu Huzaifa had been a member of Isis and had travelled to Syria. But reporting on shared intelligence – especially from a war zone – can be complicated, said Davis. We started to wonder – is this all bullshit? Is this just some fantastical story? “It’s very easy for this to develop into a bit of a game of telephone [also known as ‘Chinese whispers’], especially if you’re not actively involved in the investigation,” she said. “Based on who’s talking to who, it quite easily could have become circular reporting.” Eventually, the Caliphate podcast itself highlighted a number of inconsistencies in Chaudhry’s version of events. But earlier this week, the paper announced it would revisit its entire reporting of his story. In addition to questions over reporting, the saga of Abu Huzaifa has also exposed the complexities around laying charges under Canada’s terror laws. “It hugely undermines national security when the public feels that the authorities are unable to deal with the threat,” said Shaikh. But for Canadian officials, Chaudhry’s boasts weren’t enough: they needed hard evidence but there was little to corroborate many of his most damning claims. In the end, they charged him under Canada’s terrorism hoax laws – more normally used for offences such as fake bomb scares. “Hoaxes can generate fear within our communities and create the illusion there is a potential threat,” the police force said in a statement. Experts say that the tactic is not without risk. In addition to the challenge of proving a negative – that something didn’t happen – security agencies are often hesitant to reveal investigative techniques used to obtain evidence in court, especially for a charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years. “I think it’s sometimes beneficial for law enforcement and security services to be seen as omnipotent by people who are maybe less aware of their limitations,” said Davis. She cautions that the government’s contention that Chaudhry is lying doesn’t rule out the possibility that he may have still committed the acts he claimed. Shaikh also harbours concerns about Chaudhry, who spent years building up an identity as an Isis supporter. “He’s an Isis cheerleader and he created this fantasy story of himself,” he said. “And he’s come to believe it 100%. Even if he drops his story, he’s still an Isis supporter – because what other identity does he have?” Unless new evidence emerges, the truth is likely to remain unknown, said Davis. “We may never get a satisfying answer to this question of what he did – or didn’t – do,” she said."
86,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/02/frank-windsor-obituary,Obituary  Frank Windsor ,"A policeman’s lot is not a happy one for the actor stuck playing him for most of his professional life. Frank Windsor, who has died aged 92, was, as DS John Watt, one of the longest-serving coppers on the TV beat – in Z Cars and its BBC sequels and spin-offs from 1962 right through to 1978. At this point, Windsor returned to the theatre to play a dotty doctor in Tom Stoppard’s Every Good Boy Deserves Favour at the Mermaid theatre – music by André Previn, direction by Trevor Nunn – revealing another side of his talent altogether, that of an incisive and hilarious comic actor; he’d given us a taste of that when he took over briefly from Patrick Stewart as an absurdly barnstorming Vladimir Lenin in Stoppard’s Travesties at the Aldwych (1974). But it proved impossible for him to shake off the long arm of the law enforcer. Z Cars was indeed one of the great programmes of its time, and few dramatic double acts on the small screen – outside of Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise – matched that of Stratford Johns as the blunderbuss, truculent DI Charles Barlow and Windsor’s stern and more sympathetically malleable Watt as they chased down the criminals in Newtown, a fictional version of the overspill town of Kirkby housing in Merseyside. Z Cars moved the issues of control in public and private arenas into the new postwar realities of the welfare state, unemployment, domestic violence, gang rivalry and cultural fragmentation. Week in, week out, brilliantly acted and produced, it was compelling viewing. After three years, in 1966, Barlow and Watt were detached, promoted – to detective chief superintendent and detective chief inspector, respectively – and relocated in a new series, Softly Softly, to the fictional region of Wyvern, somewhere near Bristol. They moved on again, in 1969, to Thamesford constabulary’s CID taskforce, the series renamed Softly Softly: Task Force. When Johns peeled off into his own series, Barlow at Large, Windsor as Watt battled on for another seven years – until 1973 – with a variety of different partners on crime watch. But the pair were reunited on two mini-series within the franchise, the first, in 1973, reopening the case files on the Jack the Ripper murders of the 1880s, the second re-examining other, more recent real-life murder cases. Windsor, who was born Frank W Higgins, in Walsall, Staffordshire – his father was an accountant in local government – must have wondered whether he was an actor or a policeman. He was educated at Queen Mary’s grammar school in Walsall and trained for the stage in London at the Central School of Speech and Drama, still situated in those days, the early 1950s, at the Royal Albert Hall. He toured in Britain and India with the Elizabethan Theatre Company of Thane Parker, who also ran the Oxford Playhouse, where Parker appointed a young Peter Hall as artistic director in 1954. The actors alongside Windsor in that first Oxford season of Hall included Billie Whitelaw, Maggie Smith, Tony Church and Ronald (later Ronnie) Barker, and he soon moved into television playing the Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria in a BBC Sunday Night Theatre play of 1955 and, in 1957, the Duke of Norfolk in a television version of Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons, three years before it became a West End hit. Windsor’s experience in Shakespeare with Parker made him well qualified to play the Earl of Warwick and Sir Walter Blunt, among other characters, in the landmark BBC series of Shakespeare histories, An Age of Kings (1960). He played a dentist in Lindsay Anderson’s new-wave movie This Sporting Life (1963), with Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts, but his movie career – small parts in Peter Hammond’s Spring and Port Wine (1970) with James Mason, and John Schlesinger’s Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971) with Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch – never took off thanks to his police duties. When he did break out, into the Stoppard stage roles, he underlined his rich vocal authority and commanding presence in another dimension. He followed up with a West End thriller, Mr Fothergill’s Murder (1982) by Modesty Blaise author Peter O’Donnell at the Duke of York’s, with Rula Lenska and David Horovitch, and joined the takeover cast – Mary Miller, Miriam Karlin and Joss Ackland – in Hugh Whitemore’s spies-in-suburbia drama Pack of Lies at the Lyric in 1984. And then there was a 12-week national tour of a play unpromisingly titled Holmes and the Ripper that never hit Shaftesbury Avenue. Television fame did not translate into theatrical stardom, perhaps unjustly, and he spent the last 20 years of his active career propping up such long-running series as Lovejoy, EastEnders (as Major Charlie Grace, in just one episode), Midsomer Murders, Peak Practice, Casualty and, in 2002, as Sir James Valentine, Judge John Deed with Martin Shaw and Jenny Seagrove. This was good work, but he couldn’t shake off John Watt. He came close, though, as Gridley, “the man from Shropshire”, in the BBC’s second of their three versions to date of Dickens’s Bleak House, starring Diana Rigg and Denholm Elliott in 1985, making an excellent fist of the ruined old Chancery suitor with a combative look and a chafing, dissatisfied manner. Windsor is survived by his wife, Mary Corbett, a former dancer, and a daughter, Amanda. A son, David, died in a car accident in 1997. • Frank Windsor, actor, born 12 July 1928; died 30 September 2020"
87,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/02/we-only-just-averted-a-hundred-person-bbq-a-lecturers-freshers-week-diary,A lecturer's freshers' week diary  'Colleagues are penalised for raising health and safety issues'  ,"MondayMy colleagues and I set foot on campus for the first time since March. We had to schedule a time to visit as it’s still too dangerous for too many people to be present. This gives us an hour to understand how things work in our “Covid-secure” campus, just days before students start returning. Most of us are pretty nervous about visiting the campus for personal reasons (children at home, ageing parents, partners who work for the NHS). Reports of the role universities are playing in new cases worry us, too. Several colleagues had something that swept through our overcrowded offices in February and early March which many of us now think was coronavirus. Members of staff and students’ families have died from the virus. We have been assured by the university’s management that all is in place for face-to-face teaching: everything deep cleaned, numerous hand sanitiser stations, social distancing in classrooms, masks required in shared areas, one-way systems. But that’s not the reality. The carpets and walls in many classrooms look dirty. Our offices are just as we left them – grotty tea cups and all. It looks like a ghost town. There are only a few hand sanitiser stations scattered throughout the building.  The shields in some classrooms look very DIY; one protective shield in a seminar room might actually be a clear shower curtain. We’re supposed to teach students whose desks are way too close to us behind a makeshift plastic sheet. In another, screens separating desks are made of some kind of painted plywood. Students sitting there wouldn’t be able to see their lecturer. The university is telling students that, although obligatory in hallways and communal areas, masks will not be required in classrooms. We’re in classrooms for hours at a time, often working at close proximity to students. The university has told us to buy our own face shields if we want them. The only thing that has been fully completed is the placement of signs everywhere declaring that the building is Covid-secure, as if saying it makes it true. Trying to figure out the route to my classrooms, I follow the new one-way system arrows only to run into a “do not enter” sign. I stare at the red circle, confused as to my next move. How will hundreds of students manage this?  TuesdayI host a Zoom Q&A for returning students. Many are deciding to stay at home and continue their classes remotely. Quite a few think cities aren’t safe, or that Britain isn’t taking this seriously enough. Some have doubts about the university’s readiness. I agree with them, but am supposed to pretend that all is well.  Most of my students are not party animals, contrary to what you see in media coverage. They are taking this seriously, and have deep concerns. In March, several of them nervously asked me to start teaching online since Covid was spreading through the halls of residence and they needed to go home to their families. As a result, I went online before the government and the university required us to do so. If the UK had locked down that same week, tens of thousands of people might not have died. The current musings from scientists about doing too little, too late this time around fill me with an eerie deja vu. Suddenly, the government has announced new precautions, including the rule of six. All of our timetables will have to change, and smaller groups will mean we have to teach the same class multiple times. No one has spoken to us about workload. Several of my colleagues are starting to have anxiety issues. Again. The semester hasn’t even started and I’m exhausted. Again. Wednesday One of my students asks if we can chat on the phone. Normally students stop seeing me in June, but not this year. We’ve been having to provide a lot more support, which we’re not trained for. All summer, students have asked me an academic question then quickly shifted to talking about their loneliness, financial worries, family dysfunction in close quarters, anxiety, depression and fears about the future. I am not a counsellor, but I do what I can. The student I’m talking to has already lost several family members to the virus. She’s calling because she can’t afford a better internet connection and computer. She’s worried that it’s affecting her studies. I tell her that she can now come to campus to use the computers. She goes silent. I ask her what’s wrong. She’s embarrassed to say that she’s afraid to come to campus, because she doesn’t want to start another Covid cycle in her family. She asks whether people will be wearing masks. I tell her that I require it in my classroom, but the university only expects it in hallways. That brings a derisive: “Hmmph”. She asks if the university will be checking temperatures when students arrive. I tell her no. She laughs and says: “Well I’ll bring my temperature gun and we’ll make a game of it.” ThursdayOur approach to freshers’ week is a mix of online and offline activities. There’s more emphasis on freshers being on campus for induction and teaching so they can have the “university experience”. My colleagues and I have noticed the management team’s obsession with this idea. They think that by offering a lot of face-to-face teaching we were able to be more competitive with universities which were more conservative about opening their campuses. Given the new government guidance, our students’ union’s freshers’ plans are cancelled. We only just averted a hundred-person BBQ with drinking games, a networking event at a popular bar venue, a foam party at a nightclub, and a karaoke night by about 24 hours. Though we all feel bad that young people don’t get to have all the fun we did at uni, my colleagues and I weren’t excited about being face-to-face with people who had attended a string of parties.  FridayOther universities have locked their students down in halls of residence, and the return of students to university areas seems to be causing outbreaks. Is anyone actually surprised? Another worrying headline: scientists think universities should only have a third of their students on campus. We have more than two-thirds of our student body returning, so we may have a lot of work to redo timetables. Today we were all supposed to attend an induction event for freshers on campus, but only half of us are here. A few of my colleagues objected, citing the government’s latest directive about doing everything you can from home. I came to avoid the inevitable hassle of getting penalised for complaining. Many of my colleagues who have raised health and safety issues have been given extra work or had their teaching preparation efforts weirdly scrutinised.  I have to take public transport at rush hour to attend. It is crowded in spite of the government’s new instructions. When I arrive, the students are bored with the endless PowerPoint presentations.At the end, I hear one saying to agreement from some others: “Glad I risked my life for that. They should have done all this online.” I see another group of students who have followed the one-way arrows and made it to the end of the hallway where I had found myself trapped on Monday. “How do we get out of here?” they shout. I am not sure how to answer. • The headline on this article was amended on 2 October 2020 to better reflect the main issues in the diary."

A government spokesperson in France wished the US leader a swift recovery but questioned Trump’s repeated dismissals of the risks of the disease. “This demonstrates that the virus spares no one, including those who have shown scepticism,” Gabriel Attal said. State-controlled media in China, a country Trump has sought to blame for the pandemic, was more cutting: “President Trump and the first lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the Covid-19,” tweeted Hu Xijin, editor in chief of China’s Global Times newspaper. In the US, words of support came from across the political divide. Trump’s election rival, Joe Biden, said he was praying “for the health and safety of the president and his family.” Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family. Rev Jessie Jackson, the civil rights activist, wrote: “We must all pray for the full recovery of the president [and] his wife. For whatever religious or political persuasion you may be, we must all pray as millions of people are affected by this disease.” We sincerely pray the President& the First Lady do not have the worst of this disease.We must all pray for the full recovery of the President& his wife.For whatever religious or political persuasion you may be, we must all pray as millions of people are affected by this disease. When the pandemic struck, Jackson had written to Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people incarcerated in the US – many of whom have died or fallen ill as serious outbreaks spread through the prison system. Rachel Maddow – a host on MSBNC who has been highly critical of the president – wrote: “God bless the president and the first lady. If you pray, please pray for their speedy and complete recovery – and for everyone infected, everywhere.” Tulsi Gabbard, the congresswoman for Hawaii who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, sent “best wishes … during this difficult time”. My husband Abraham and I offer our best wishes and aloha to President @realDonaldTrump and the First Lady @FLOTUS and praying for their speedy recovery. We also send our best wishes to Ivanka, Tiffany, Donald Trump Jr., Eric, and Barron during this difficult time. #TrumpHasCovid Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said Trump’s diagnosis “is a total failure” by the White House team to protect the president. This is a nightmare. COVID19 is a serious infection, especially for someone who is older like Mr. Trump.I can't believe he was infected. This is a total failure by WH team to protect the PresidentWishing both the President and The First Lady and speedy recovery. https://t.co/YVA2WpeNCu World leaders, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who himself contracted coronavirus, also offered support. Like millions of Israelis, Sara and I are thinking of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump and wish our friends a full and speedy recovery. https://t.co/UcxQpsxBLE My best wishes to President Trump and the First Lady. Hope they both have a speedy recovery from coronavirus. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, opted for a telegram to wish Trump a swift recovery. “I am certain that your inherent vitality, good spirits and optimism will help you cope with this dangerous virus,” the message read. Many others pointed out that Trump, who has flouted public health recommendations, refusing to wear a mask to protect himself and others from the spread of disease, should have expected this outcome. “BET YOU WANNA” wear a mask now 😩😩😩 https://t.co/jp6NTiGztO The writer Tracy Clayton recalled the moment when the president had suggested people might inject bleach as a treatment for the disease. has he tried injecting disinfectants yet? George Conway, an outspoken critic of Trump and a lawyer who is married to the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, wrote: “He failed to protect the country. He couldn’t even protect himself.” He failed to protect the country. He couldn't even protect himself."
89,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/after-hong-kong-china-taiwan-invasion-armed-forces,After Hong Kong  China sets sights on solving 'the Taiwan problem' ,"Soon after China imposed the new national security law that effectively ended Hong Kong’s limited autonomy, a hawkish legal academic  in Beijing spelt out a warning to Taiwan. The law was not just about ending a year of protests in Hong Kong, Tian Feilong said in an interview with DW News, it was also sending a message to Taipei – and to Washington, which has recently approved new arms sales and high-level visits by US officials to self-rule Taiwan. The provisions being used to crush dissent across Hong Kong could provide a template, he argued, for tackling “the Taiwan problem”. “I believe that in the future, you could just change the name of the Hong Kong national security law, and substitute instead ‘Taiwan national security law’,” said Tian. To implement a national security law in Taiwan, Beijing would first need to take military control of the island, which has had its own government since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. An invasion once seemed unlikely, both because China lacked the military capacity to take an island armed with advanced US weaponry, and because it could not afford the international reaction to such a move. Neither of those restraining factors hold true now. Since 2013 the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has presided over an extensive military overhaul, increasing investment in hi-tech weapons and shaking up an antiquated structure that sidelined the navy and airforce, both of which would be vital for a successful invasion of an island. “Being able to sail over to Taiwan and occupy [it by force] ... is for the first time in the history of China, going to be possible,” said Dr Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Stanford University who specialises in Chinese military and security policy. The national security law China imposed on Hong Kong in June 2020 has wrought profound changes on the region of more than 7 million people. From who really runs Hong Kong now to the fate of the pro-democracy movement and how major global companies are grappling with the implications of the new law, our reporters in China, Hong Kong, London, the US and Australia have investigated how the unprecedented crackdown affects not only Hong Kong, but the world.  As well as charting the new restrictions on freedoms and civil liberties, the series seeks out voices of hope and acts of resistance - and asks what next for Hong Kong, as it stands at a crossroads in its history. Chinese analysts have told Mastro that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could have the capacity to mount an invasion of Taiwan in a year or two; she and other US experts believe the real date will be towards the end of the decade, perhaps 2028. “Even if you think China won’t do that [invade], it surely is going to change the calculations to have that option in the back of their head,” Mastro said. “I would argue that they’re likely to be a little bit more risk taking, a little bit more aggressive.” Xi has already upended a decade-long commitment to cautious foreign policy, encapsulated by a favourite maxim of the former leader Deng Xiaoping: “Hide your strength, bide your time.” Deng, who ushered in far-reaching market reforms, argued that China could not afford international tensions and should avoid aggression as its economy recovered from the ravages of Maoism. Now Xi, who has promised a “national rejuvenation”, leads the world’s second largest economy and has pursued an aggressive foreign policy, including territorial claims from the border with India in the west to the South China Sea in the east. Ho-fung Hung, professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University, does not think an invasion of Taiwan is imminent, but says Hong Kong’s security law sent a very clear message about China’s long-term plans. “The national security law in Hong Kong is very important to show that Beijing is ready to defy international outcry,” he said. “It will be a kind of a warning to Taiwan: ’Don’t think that Beijing would not take military action. Don’t think that we will fear international reaction.’” Taiwan has enjoyed de-facto independence since the end of the civil war in 1949, when the losing Kuomintang faction fled to the island. Its leader, Chiang Kai-shek, presided for years over a dictatorship, dreaming of retaking mainland China. But a slow democratisation process began in 1987, and since then Taiwan has become a robust liberal democracy, the only place in Asia to have legalised gay marriage, and whose population increasingly identify as Taiwanese, not Chinese. For a variety of reasons, most notably its world-leading success in responding to the coronavirus pandemic, Taiwan’s global status has grown dramatically in 2020. This month Time magazine put president Tsai Ing-wen on its 100 most influential people list. But Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taipei back under Chinese control, and Xi has made clear in recent years that “reunifying” Taiwan with China is a key goal. Amid escalating broader tensions with the US and with politicians worldwide distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, top Chinese officials have been using unusually aggressive rhetoric in recent months. There has also been an escalation in military provocations by China, including incursions into Taiwanese airspace and drills near the island’s territorial waters. Hong Kong is a mirror of our future The latest challenge came during a recent visit by Keith Krach, US undersecretary of state for economic affairs. The PLA sent nearly 40 aircraft across the median line of the strait of Taiwan, an unofficial dividing line that had been largely respected by both sides, until China began regularly crossing it last year, and in September denied it existed. Taiwan’s foreign minister told China to “back off”, and Wang Ting-yu, who chairs Taiwan’s foreign affairs and defence committee, insists the Taiwanese military could hold off the PLA despite some major gaps in its underwater and missile capabilities. “Hong Kong is a mirror of our future if Taiwan becomes part of China,” he said, pointing out that Tsai has bolstered defence spending. “We have to protect our national security.” But Wang’s words are more the bravado of a politician, than the assessment of a military analyst. For decades Taiwan has been protected by the sophistication of weapons Washington has sold to the island – $23bn (£17.8bn) worth over the past decade – and by the prospect of military help from the US fleet and bases around the region in case of invasion. The Taiwanese military is dwarfed by its Chinese counterpart – Taiwan has less than a fifth of China’s planes, a 10th of its armed forces personnel and just o1% of its missiles. The details of the US military aid has never been spelt out. Washington has instead embraced a policy of “strategic ambiguity”, which aims to deter China from attacking Taiwan and deter Taipei from provoking military aggression from Beijing. But there are increasingly urgent calls in the US for a more proactive policy, to respond to a more aggressive China. The Trump administration has already publicly stepped up support for Taiwan in diplomatic and military areas while wider US-China relations have deteriorated further. “The policy of ‘strategic ambiguity’ is dead,” said James Fanell, a retired naval officer, who was director for intelligence and information operations for the US navy’s Pacific fleet. Over a 30-year career Fanell specialised in Indo-Asia Pacific security affairs, with an emphasis on the Chinese navy. He argues that a stronger regional military presence and firmer commitment to Taiwan’s defence is necessary to protect the island. “The US military posture in Asia has essentially remained consistent in terms of military force structure for the past two decades. While that force structure would have been adequate two decades ago, it is wholly inadequate today,” Fanell said. Washington should shift its deployments away from the Atlantic, so 60% to 70% of US navy and air force is focused on the Indo-Pacific region, Fanell said. This would not be a disinterested policy. Taiwan is an important ally, but its location is also strategically important if the US wants to counter Chinese influence in the region. “Like Japan understood in the second world war, Taiwan is the unsinkable aircraft carrier that can launch attacks southwards towards the South China Sea, eastward against places like Guam, and northwards towards Japan and events on the Korean peninsula. This fact is well understood in Washington,” Fanell said. China and the US have be close to military conflict over Taiwan before, in the 1950s, and in the 1990s, but the relationship between Beijing and Washington may now be approaching its most volatile stage in decades. Even if Beijing is not yet ready to risk a full-scale invasion, it may consider other military action against Taiwan, to test Taiwanese and international response to aggression while bolstering its strategic position, said Dr Mathieu Duchâtel, director of the Asia programme at the Institut Montaigne. “Limited coercive actions to shape public opinion in Taiwan through shock and fear are a realistic scenario,” he argued in a recent analysis. “China has real options, a record of calculated risk under Xi Jinping, deep concerns regarding the future course of US-Taiwan relations, and a lack of realistic soft alternatives to ‘seduce’ [Taiwan].” One possible target are the Pratas islands, three atolls with no permanent inhabitants and hundreds of miles south of Taipei. A large-scale cyber-attack on critical infrastructure is another potential scenario, said Duchâtel. Mastro said war between China and the US over Taiwan was more likely than people realise. She argues the best way to stave off conflict is an aggressive commitment to Taiwan’s security from Washington and a beefing up of US military capacity in the region. “The United States focuses on imposing costs on China, but the benefits to regaining Taiwan – in the minds of the Chinese government – are so huge, it’s really hard to think of a cost that could dissuade them if that was a possibility,” Mastro said."

But Donald Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka, did not emerge from recent revelations over his financial affairs unscathed. A nugget in the New York Times’s investigation into the US president’s tax returns could potentially cause lasting damage to Ivanka, currently a senior adviser to the president and a leading surrogate for his re-election campaign. She apparently received “consulting fees” paid by the Trump Organization, helping reduce the Trump family’s tax bill, while she was simultaneously an employee of the organization. “Trump’s private records show that his company once paid $747,622 in fees to an unnamed consultant for hotel projects in Hawaii and Vancouver, British Columbia,” the Times noted. “Ivanka Trump’s public disclosure forms – which she filed when joining the White House staff in 2017 – show that she had received an identical amount through a consulting company she co-owned.” While Trump was quick to issue his standard defense, dismissing the tax report as “fake news”, Ivanka has been conspicuously silent about her alleged violation. In the past she has worked to put daylight between herself and the biggest scandals of her father’s administration. Joshua Kendall, author of First Dads: Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama, said: “There seems to be an overlap in terms of her declaring that same amount of money on her financial disclosure so this really could be very, very damaging. There has been some speculation about a criminal prosecution. This could really be a turning point for her.” Such a development would be a rare setback for Ivanka, 38, whose husband, Jared Kushner, is also a senior adviser at the White House, and who has long enjoyed perceived status as Trump’s golden child. She introduced him to the Republican national convention in 2016 and again this year, when she frequently used the first person pronoun to put herself at the heart of his presidency. Examples included: “I sat with him in the Oval Office as he stopped travel to Europe”; “I was with my father when he decided to commute Alice’s life sentence”; “I stood by my father’s side at Dover air force base as he has received our fallen heroes”. And: “Four years ago, I told you I would fight alongside my father, and, four years later, here I am.” The speech fueled speculation that Ivanka is positioning herself as an heir apparent. Maureen Dowd, a New York Times columnist, wrote: “Ivanka must realize now that she and Jared can never go back to their life as New York society darlings. So why not double down on Washington and lay the groundwork for a presidential run of her own?” The dynastic notion resurfaced this week when a book by Rick Gates, Trump’s former deputy campaign manager, suggested that the Republican nominee wanted to name Ivanka as his running mate in 2016. Ivanka herself reportedly told her father it was not a good idea and he eventually chose Mike Pence. Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a group led by anti-Trump Republican consultants, dismissed the idea of Ivanka running for president in 2024 or beyond. “She and her bizarre android husband are planning great things for their future, but it doesn’t mean they’re gonna be viable in terms of winning and holding higher office,” he said. Other commentators suggest that, while Ivanka will follow her father’s example by shrugging off this latest political controversy, the legal implications could be more damaging. Michael D’Antonio, a political analyst and author of The Truth About Trump, said: “I think that she has ambition, period, so there’s no doubt that she imagines herself to be a prominent figure indefinitely. I don’t know Trumps believe that anything that comes out about them is significantly troublesome; they feel that they can talk their way out of anything where their base is concerned. “But this payment may have criminal repercussions that are more significant. If she knowingly accepted this money and did it with any understanding that it was in order to evade taxes, and then her father signed the tax returns knowingly, both of them could have criminal liability. So I don’t think it’s a small thing that can just be written off as: “Oh well, it’s too bad that she made this mistake.’”"

  This government's incompetence is no accident. It was inevitable ","The serial incompetence of Boris Johnson’s government is not an accident. It may look like haplessness, but that is to mistake the symptom for the cause. Instead this government’s ineptitude is a function of both the character of the man at the top and the defining creed of his administration. Reminders of our rulers’ clumsiness arrive with such regularity that it’s easy to become inured. This week we had the prime minister “misspeak” as he botched an attempt to explain the new regulations imposed by the government he leads. Perhaps that’s an easy mistake to make, considering the ever-shifting nature of the advice, best captured by that short video of Matt Lucas channelling the PM as he tells Britons, “Go to work, don’t go to work. Go outside, don’t go outside.” But it hardly excuses the repeating pattern of errors that has blighted the government’s response to coronavirus from the start. You’ll recall the contact-tracing app that Matt Hancock hailed as a crucial weapon in the fight against the pandemic. It was scrapped in June after trials found it didn’t work, and relaunched last week – only for it to be exposed as carrying a pretty major bug. It turned out that users of the NHS Covid-19 app who had been tested in NHS hospitals couldn’t enter their results. An app with NHS branding all over it would only accept results done outside the NHS, by private, outsourced companies. That problem has been partially fixed now, but it was par for what has been a very bumpy course. From those critical seven days that were wasted before a clearly inevitable national lockdown was imposed in March – a delay that Prof Neil Ferguson, then on the Sage committee, estimates to have cost 20,000 lives – to the multimillion-pound contracts handed to pals to supply PPE that turned out to be useless against Covid, Johnson and his team have blundered at every turn. The result is that the UK has managed to score a rare double: notching up the highest death toll in Europe along with the severest economic slump in the world. But this is not just bad luck, an unfortunate coincidence that saw a global health crisis collide with a set of ministers sadly unsuited to the task. Governments don’t just happen to be incapable – or capable, for that matter. On the contrary, if you want competence, competence has to be prized. Take the last Labour government, particularly in its first term. Determined to rid the party of its historic association with economic failure, culminating in the IMF bailout and the “winter of discontent”, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown prized efficiency – sometimes to a fault – promoting the quiet and technocratic over the loud and inspiring. Brown apart, its longest-serving cabinet minister was Alistair Darling, never happier than when making no news. The mantra of the age was “what works”. Johnson’s administration places no such premium on good governance. Why might that be? First, look to the top. All institutions ultimately reflect the personality and priorities of the person in charge, governments especially. Even the prime minister’s admirers don’t pretend that he’s a details man, across policy and process. One colleague says of Johnson’s earlier spell as the capital’s mayor: “He was basically chaotic, shagging his way around London, writing articles,” leaving the actual work to his staff. Recall last year’s revelation of a scribbled note referring to his predecessor as “girly swot Cameron”. Put aside the reflexive sexism and absorb a work ethic so lax it regards Notting Hill’s king of chillax as a relentless Stakhanovite. Still, Johnson’s character surely matters less than the animating project of his government: Brexit. One only has to survey the cabinet to see that he rates fidelity to Brexit as a greater virtue than even rudimentary aptitude. That’s why this government has room for Gavin Williamson and Dominic Raab, but cast out the likes of David Gauke and Dominic Grieve. That’s why its choice to head parliament’s intelligence and security committee was Chris Grayling. (There can surely be no other explanation for that one.) But Brexit plays a deeper role than mere loyalty test. For Dominic Cummings in particular always conceived this mission as less about breaking from the European Union than remaking the British state. Out would go the elitist experts – who, as Cummings’ first patron, Michael Gove, memorably remarked, the country had had enough of – and in would come a gang of anarchistic tech-wizards armed with supercomputers and reams of data. For this is the defining ethos of the Cummings-Johnson, Brexit administration: to purge expertise and tear down what works. The proof is the six Whitehall permanent secretaries driven out this year, or the never-ending efforts to hobble the BBC. Instead of cherishing the experienced public servants the nation needs to get us through this crisis, it regards them as the “enemy within”, who will face a “hard rain”. “At the heart of the project,” says one Conservative former minister, “is this insurgent, anti-government, anti-establishment zeal, but guess what: you can’t govern if you don’t believe in government.” The result is not just incompetence but also a curious contradiction. Cummings poses as the great libertarian decentraliser, but because he trusts no one but himself and his handpicked circle, he centralises ever more power to himself and what one insider calls “his spad boys in No 10”. No wonder Britain has failed to get a functioning test-and-trace system in place while the data and decision-making is jealously hoarded at the centre, rather than allowed to sit with those on the spot. So this government will keep messing up, of course it will. Covid has ripped the mask off the man who leads it and exposed its driving purpose. It has revealed both for what they are. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"

The US president continued to carry out his duties under quarantine from the White House residence on Friday and was showing “mild symptoms” of Covid-19, an official said. But his election campaigning was on hold. The Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, said late Friday afternoon that he had tested negative for the virus. He continued on the campaign trail, making a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, while wearing a mask and advocating mask-wearing, something the president has conspicuously equivocated on. Biden had earlier tweeted good wishes to Donald and Melania Trump and in his speech, added: “My wife Jill and I pray they’ll make a quick and full recovery. This is not a matter of politics. It’s a bracing reminder to all of us we have to take this virus seriously.” The virus can take several days to manifest fully and Trump, aged 74 and clinically obese, is medically vulnerable. Should he be incapacitated, Mike Pence, the vice-president, who has tested negative, would take over. A presidential election takes place on 3 November. Trump, who has spent months defying science and downplaying the threat of a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans, was also facing criticism for pressing ahead with a campaign fundraising event after learning that a senior aide, Hope Hicks, had tested positive. One attendee said the president came into contact with about 100 people at the fundraiser in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday and “seemed lethargic”, the New York Times reported. Trump has travelled extensively in recent days, to a presidential debate, a campaign rally and the fundraiser. A scramble was under way to test those who have been with him at close quarters.  The first lady, Melania Trump, also tested positive and tweeted: “I have mild symptoms but overall feeling good. I am looking forward to a speedy recovery.” On Friday, the Utah senator Mike Lee, who attended the White House event last Saturday where Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett for the supreme court, also said he had tested positive. The White House moved to assuage fears of a constitutional and national security crisis. “The president does have mild symptoms and as we look to try to make sure that not only his health and safety and welfare is good, we continue to look at that for all of the American people,” Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, told reporters. “He continues to be not only in good spirits but very energetic. We’ve talked a number of times this morning, I’ve got the five or six things he tasked me to do, like I do every single morning and he is certainly wanting to make sure we stay engaged.” Meadows, not wearing a face mask, said:  “The American people can rest assured that we have a president that is not only on the job, will remain on the job, and I’m optimistic that he’ll have a very quick and speedy recovery.” Early on Friday afternoon, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, Bill Stepien, put out a statement that read: “All previously announced campaign events involving the president’s participation are in the process of being moved to virtual events or are being temporarily postponed. In addition, previously announced events involving members of the first family are also being temporarily postponed. All other campaign events will be considered on a case-by-case basis and we will make any relevant announcements in the days ahead.” He added: “Vice-President Mike Pence, who has tested negative for Covid-19, plans on resuming his scheduled campaign events. Any further information about the president will come from the White House.” Similarly, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader and a Trump ally, tweeted that he and Trump had been discussing the president’s nomination of a supreme court justice. “Just finished a great phone call with POTUS,” he wrote. “He’s in good spirits and we talked business – especially how impressed Senators are with the qualifications of Judge Barrett. Full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the court and the country deserve,” he added, referring to Amy Coney Barrett, the president’s nominee to fill the seat on the supreme court left by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg two weeks ago. But the administration’s frequent false and misleading statements about the pandemic left many observers sceptical about the reassurances. And the US has a long history of failing to be transparent about presidents’ health problems. The news broke just before 1am on Friday when Trump tweeted: “Tonight, FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” The announcement came hours after he confirmed that Hope Hicks, one of his close aides, had been diagnosed with the virus on Thursday. Hicks reportedly began feeling mild symptoms during a flight home from a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday evening and was isolated from other passengers onboard the plane. Even after Hicks fell ill, Trump went ahead with his engagement in Bedminster, potentially exposing attendees to the virus. Trump’s social media director, Dan Scavino, and press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who were originally set to join him on the trip, were replaced at the last minute by other aides. Just after 4pm on Friday, McEnany tweeted an update on Trump’s health and that he had been given the antibody cocktail Regeneron. An update from President @realDonaldTrump's physician: pic.twitter.com/cTsXO4Df6b Trump has a low-grade fever, nasal congestion and cough, the New York Times reported, adding that a national address or a videotaped statement by Trump was being discussed at the White House. Trump’s infection upends a presidential election. More than a million people have voted early. The president had been holding campaign rallies crammed with supporters often not wearing face masks or keeping their distance, defying federal guidelines.  Trump now finds himself grounded with rallies on hold. It is also unclear whether the next debate against Biden will go ahead, or be held in virtual form on 15 October. The vice-presidential debate between Pence and the Democrat Kamala Harris next Wednesday was still set to go ahead. New: The University of Utah is set to host the VP debate as planned this Wednesday, spokesman Shawn Wood tells me. Their policy will require everybody inside the security perimeter — save for the three people onstage — ""to wear masks at all times,"" Wood says. Trump and Biden did not shake hands during Tuesday’s debate, but stood without masks about 10ft apart for the 90-minute event. The president has mocked Biden for frequently wearing a mask when out in public, per federal health guidelines. “I don’t wear masks like him,” Trump said. “Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200ft away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” In an aggressive push for businesses and schools to reopen, Trump has claimed that the worst of the pandemic is over, even as infections in America surpass 7m, and federal experts have told Congress the outbreak is not under control. Four US presidents have died in office from natural causes: William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren Harding and Franklin Roosevelt. Trump’s infection is the gravest threat to an incumbent president’s health since Ronald Reagan was shot in an attempted assassination in 1981."
