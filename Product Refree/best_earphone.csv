Neon green colour looks very nice.\nDidn't find any con after listening to 12-15 different genres songs, call quality is also good.\nGo for it in this price range (450-500).\nThough I received an open box but its not related to product quality. 1 less star for delivery and packing."", 'This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.\n\nWhat an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.\n\nNow, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.\n\nIf you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.\n\nFirstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.\nThese come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.\n\nMoving on the main purpose and the bigger question ""BASS"".\nI would say it\'s perfect.\nThe sound quality is so very crisp and clear.\nBASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.\nYou may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.\nThe loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.\n\nTo check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.\n\nThe added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.\n\nSo heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.\n\nPrice: 5\nBuild Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)\nLoudness: 5\nCall Quality: 5\nBass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you\'d better be putting your ears on a loudspeaker).\n\nHope this clarifies your doubts about this product.\n\nAll in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase.', 'This is the true earphone to connect you to nirvana not for longer times because it starts pain in ear after a long time continuous use.\nBass- in the price of 450, bass is terrible. You will get powerful bass than you expect.\nSound- if a headphone has poor sound, it is not a headphone. But this one has the sound that will blow your mind totally.\n\nNoice cancellation- in the price range of 400-500 no brand will give you perfect noice cancellation headphones, but in boat bassheads, there is noice cancellation but not so good.\n\nOverall- if you have 500 rs. And you are searching for beast headphone in you budget and if you are reading reviews, and if you are reading this one, i am telling you go for it without hesitation beacuse after a long research on 2 shopping sites i found thi product best in my price range.(i bouggt it for 450).', ""If you want durable earphone, protected from sweat, water. Go for this.\n\nBuild quality: Very good form factor, braided cable with waterproof coating. Eartips are comfortable and fits nicely, looks durable.\nSound: Boat earphone, hence Bass rich, treble and mids could have been better (as I listen music in studio monitors, so I felt, not a big issue)\n\nDownsides: Wire seems very durable, but not too thick. Could've been thicker. Extra eartips only 2 small and 2 mediums. Couldve been provided more.\n\nOverall you can surely take this if you badly need waterproofing and durability, otherwise 225/152/162 has slightly better sound. But this has volume control keys, thats a plus point."", 'It is second day of my usage. I went for run with this ear phones. They claim to be sweat proof but after 2 minutes of run my mic and volume button are giving false signals. Automatically music gets change and volume goes to zero all of sudden. I think this is because of sweat and mic is mis-operating.\n\nI think we should not call earphones sweat protection if any of the system is friendly for sweat. completely disappointed with product.', ""I purchased this boat hadset, initially it was working excellent but after 2 months, I don't know whether it's a design issues or might be other problem, I contacted service center of boat. They denied to replace my headphone, staff said me that it's a special cricketer editon so I need to complain via online from the boat website and I registered a complete raised ticket but still now no reply. Poor service. till date no reply from BOAT. kindly think before buying boat products."", ""Just overdid it on the bass. There is virtually no treble. The singers voice just gets muted. Good for pew pew Hindi, pop, hip-hop type songs. I guess that's why they are sold in India. Not for metalheads! Also the eargrips are uncomfortable after long use. Needless addition. Durability I will comment a few months later. But for the price can't complain. It's no Bose."", ""Best for me. If you fall in the middle category, where you don't want the best of the best earphones but also don't want the worst, go for this.\n\nEarbuds don't fall from my ears! My ears are kind of weird. Like Amir Khan (lol). (I have had a bad past with regards to this with my previous earphones).\n\nBass is gooood. Sound clarity is also good. Some experts may say the vocal clarity is overshadowed by the bass, but I am okay with that.\n\nThe clip is very useful in preventing the earbuds from falling. I clip it on my collar.\n\nThe cable strength is also good. The cable got pulled twice by accident, and nothing happened to the earphones.\n\nThe mic is also good. I use these earphones to listen to music, watch YouTube, calling, send and listen to voice notes, etc.\n\nBest. Cheers!\nDon't think too much :)"", ""Before these earphones, I used the basic Samsung earphones which were 5 years old.\nAnd I am writing this review after 3 days of usage,daily for 3-4 hours.\n\nPros: 1- Crystal clear & loud sound. 5/5\n2- Amazing bass. 5/5\n3-Call quality is fine. 4/5\n4- The wires are braided which make them more durable. 5/5\nOne of the most amazing features is that you get sound control buttons in this earphones which work as a charm.\n\nCons :1- After continuous use for 45-60 mins, they cause pain in ears.\n2- They are MADE IN CHINA. I didn't know it before.\n\nEdit: After daily usage of almost 1 week, the right earplug is not working properly and they are causing hell lot of pain and itchiness on the ear.\nI am reducing the rating from 4 stars to 1. Also I have applied for replacement.\nI really wish, somehow refund would be possible, as I don't want to waste 500 Rs."", ""Worst sound. It's like someone is poking you with a needle in your ears.

Sent back few earphones coz of some problem. But this is all rounder.', ""Okay, some people may differ but in my opinion the bass is too much. So much that it overpowers all the other aspects of the song. If you're into EDM where it's basically bass and.... just bass, then I guess it's a good fit. But if you want to hear other genre of music, then I would advise not to buy this product. The bass is just painful and I had to return the product and buy Sennheiser CX180 instead. It's too good for the price range."", 'by look and sound it was good\nBut it has a very poor quality of wire which has been a problem of BOat.\n\nThis is my 3rd boat earphone which one side is stopped working... replacement earphone quality is also of same quality usually lasts for 1-2 months only.\n\nit has zero noise cancellation dont think about taking calls using it', 'Great product...Great sound ....And got it on deal price 449...In this price, they give volume control with great sound quality. ....must buy product', ""In this price range it's the best option.

Not meant for runners, sports or even walking for that matter.\nThe wiring inside the mic assembly where other buttons like volume controls are placed was shorting causing volume commands to be activated on slight movement of the cord around the mic module.

They are called Leaf Bolt.\n\nLeaf Bolt's sound quality and bass is far superior than Boat Bassheads 242. And I have worn them in showering rain multiple times and they have remained absolutely fine due to their water resistance tech. Go for Leaf Bolt instead if you want overall better experience and comfort as well. Or go for Realme Buds 2 or Boat Bassheads 225 if you are obsessed with earth shattering bass for this price range."", 'I was confused whether I should return or not. I have done the sound test on this boat earphone and I compared with JBL. I tried to see the difference in the same music. I am going to do sound test on Vivo earphones.

Tangle free, durable and beautiful.\n3. 1 year warranty\n4.You can remove the sports cap if you are not using for sports\n\nCons(not to buy)\n1. Treble is 0. No treble. Bass treble should have balance. Sound quality decreased. It looks someone is pressing the neck of the singer.\n2. There is no surround sound. The earphones with surround sound gives pleasure. The left music should play in left earphone and right in right earphone. It is lacking.\n3.if boat Will work on above two points. This earphon will be awesome.\n4.

But if you still like to show off JBL and Sennheiser etc, this isn't definitely for you.\n3. I don't understand bass (yeah, pronounce it as base :P) etc as I'm not musician but I like music. I don't find any difficulty or loss in the music that I want to hear.\n4. The soft ear buds make the listening experience very enjoyable.\n5. Doesn't get entangled\n6. Also, I must mention that, if there's any problem with the headphone and if it's within the warranty period, you can get it replaced easily by writing to - info@imaginemarketingindia.com.\n\nWhat I didn't like -\n1. Zero noise cancellation. If there's something going on in the background while you are speaking to someone, the person at the other end can hear every bit of that's going on in the background at your end.\n2.

If you happen to have a return then they wouldn‚Äôt refund you back.', ""Just got this after 1 day ( 1-01-2021), and i can say the quality of the earbuds isn't that great because it feels super plasticky, sound quality on the other hand is one of the best I've heard in this price, i also use realme buds2 and the sound is clearly better and clearer in this one, i listen to loads of EDM so this is on the same level or better than RealMe buds 2 in the bass department.Also the earplugs for extra fitting can be removed, i personally find them irritating so thank god for that, so far so good & will update in the future (Update 8-06-2021, left earpiece has stopped working, i never used it harshly but still it stopped working, it's been happening with every earphone i buy, max use time is 5-7 months)"", ""Great earphone, I purchased in ‚Çπ549, though currently it is available in ‚Çπ499 . Little disappointed.\nSound is amazing, cable is not that great, there are 3 buttons available. It is better than mi basic earphone that comes in 399/-\nYou can go for it without any doubt.\nEdit :-\nAfter 7 months of use suddenly it's mic has stopped working and in single attempt it doesn't connect with phone and I have to unplug and plug again to connect with phone. Mic and the buttons stopped working and this is the biggest issue with these earphone. Although sound output is still good. Just after warranty expires its mic stopped working, thats ridiculous with Boat.\nIt also don't have L shaped connector like mi basic earphone, so it's not comfortable while Playing games and connecting to laptop."", 'Sound quality is ear deafening... u can use it with 70-80% more than that u cant ..or u r crazy ...\nBASS 5/5\n\nI feel the price is affordable.5/5\n\nThe wire are very durable 5/5(Wires with nylon outer cover as of i know )\n\nthe buttons 5/5\n\nI use it as a daily driver in gym\nit wont come unless u take it out.\n\nCons: After using it for 60-70 minutes you will feel slight discomfort due to the ear wing and also you feel discomfort whiling using it in while on a pillow in bed.( the ear hooks are detachable) it gives more comfort.\n\nbut it is the best wired headset in the range and it is better than their own 225 headphones...\n\ni highly recommend it for people who need A good bass headphones', ""I don't know why everyone is hating this product. In my opinion it's details are as follows-\nPros- 1. It comes with hook that is very good to manage earphone.\n2. Earphone pouch is pretty decent.\n3. Earphone fits perfectly in ear without any chance of dropping.\n4. Sound quality is very good, It's not for very high bass lover, for in my opinion sound is perfectly tuned with treble and bass.\n5. Ear tips are very comfirtable.\n\nCons- 1. Product quality at this price range is worse. I mean wire quality is very cheap. If you are using it very roughly then it will not last long. REALME BUDS 2 are better then it.\n2. For bass lover, plz go for REALME BUDS 2, which is best product under 1000.\n3. There is no noise cancellation, which is not even available in other earphones. So it is not a big issue.\n\nThat's it. I used almost all earphone. But this is good enough and real me buds 2 is best product to buy."", 'It is one of the worst headphones I have ever used in my whole life. I wanted to get one for my calls and some light music and unfortunately fell for the reviews on this product which are a gimmick BTW. The product build quality is quite cheap, worse than those cheap Chinese headphones. They are not at all comfortable for long or even short use because once you put them, it hurts your ears. I had to end up buying another pair of headphones to get rid of these cheap and horrible product. If you are looking for comfort, better music experience for long hours, better go for headphones which are having in ear buds similar to the shape of old Apple earphones. Such in ear headphones which blocks air passing to your ear are neither healthy not comfortable.', ""For the price it is definitely a steal. It is light weight and easy to carry around. The color and design is also quite nice. The bass is exceptionally good.\n\nHowever on the flip side there's a bit of static that is very faint at times when you plug it to your phone. Songs that have bass notes sound amazing but any song that doesn't have a heavy bass, sounds pretty off, making the listening experience unpleasant. Songs that have a stronger degree of treble will sound shrill in your ear. Nonetheless, for the price it is a good bargain."", 'Build quality was ok. Initially bass was okish. But after audio tuning it felt great. Buttons functioning were gud. Might feel pain in ears if using for long tym due to ""secure ear lock"" not coz of ear piece.Absence of Gold coated Jack felt a bit down.\nOverall, a totally value for money product at such price point and a real steal deal offer ;-)', ""I have I used other boat products and was a happy customer until now. The sound quality is not bad but most likely you will not have a strong connection because of the 3.5mm jack is so slim it tends to come out all the time never stays in place if you have phone back over which we are likely to have. Major flaw in their design don't know if it's cost cutting or some failure to implement sleek design but it makes my purchase useless. Disgrace"", 'Quality is not up to the mark.

I had it before and much better than this one .\n\nOnly plus point is volume control and start stop option. This is working fine.\n\nI need to refund money and go for another product but only return option is available. I already returned one product but same problem in returned product.\n\nBab buy.. I need refund of money and go for another boat product.', ""So today I got the replaced piece, from the one delivered first, there was a disturbance with movement of the wire, which also means that the earphones won't probably last too long. But the real problem was during calls, the people on the other end complained of a disturbing noise which keeps going on and off. Even with the new ones I got today, if I just rotate the 3.5 mm connector, I can hear some little disturbance which means I might face the same problem probably with these as well but I am not going through the pain of replacing these again, also to be fair I need to test these new ones a little more.\n\nThe sound quality otherwise is decent, sound a bit too high I think, like 50% is good enough for me and 70-75% is too high and 100% is just not bearable for more than a second!\nAs I said earlier, these are OK, you can buy these and you might be satisfied, but you can also look for other options in this price range."", 'In the first 4-5 months they will work perfectly and you think you cannot get such sound quality at this price. But after 6 months they started to give a constant ""husss"" sound. After one more month it was unable to play some notes well (sound distorts while playing some notes).\n\nI have to emphasize here that the earphones were very well treated - no major bends etc in the wire - no wear on the product itself. But they will fail after 6-8 months.\n\nMy previous boat earphones were boat bassheads 200 and some other bassheads in the rs500-600 category. Each of the product failed within 12 months - some failed earlier. My conclusion is that these guys spend money in tuning (Bass good) and celebrity promotions of their products compared to the actual quality of drivers which is the poorest. So after 3 failed products within the warranty I am not going to bother purchasing another boat product again.', ""I was glad to buy boat earphones supporting Made in India, but the product did not reached my expectations\nThere are many cons like\n1. Rubber earsfit are not soft and is available only in large size. It does hurts for small eared people. Either discontinue giving them along or provide them in every size.\n2.

Water resistant\n3. Built Quality is good and cables doesn't tangle.\n4. Carrying pouch is attractive.\n\nI suggest boat to remake them around 1k or near and provide good accessories and balance Treble and bass.

I gave it a shot and bought these earphones after reading several positive reviews. For this price there are no other better earphones out there. First thing I noticed was how strong the connecting cables were, much tougher and sturdier as compared to other well known brands. The earpieces also fit tightly into the ears and seem on the harder side. They will never fall off from the ears. Sound quality is above average as compared to their next product in the hierarchy. Frankly the only missing part is the heavy bass.(this comparison is unfair as I also use Sony XB 550) Other than that an excellent product.', ""Okay product. Will comment in 3-6 months regarding durability.\nThese are supposed to be basshead earphones but I don't think they qualify - not at their price range.\nThey don't really boost bass just amplify it and make the entire lower range frequency louder. As a result, if you go above the halfway volume mark, the sound sort of starts cracking and hurting ears. The problem goes away a bit when you tweak the sound settings. However, the range is small. If you optimize settings for bass, then treble starts cracking, and if you optimise for middle range sounds (can't really get a good treble), then bass starts cracking. Just not satisfactory for me.\nOf course, everyone's taste in music is different and their requirements from earphones are different. Obviously, I listen to everything from Opera and Death metal to bluegrass and hip-hop to rap and jazz to Punjabi upbeat songs and Ghazals. So this earphone covers only a fraction of all that and hence I do not particularly like them even for the price of rs 379 that I paid in the lightning deal. There were a few cheaper earphones that were much better than these and I only bought this because they were out of stock.\n\nHowever, if your taste in music covers a narrow frequency range and similar genres and you just want loud percussion sounds and don't care about much else, go for it.\n\nAs for watching TV shows and Movies, earphones generally don't affect the experience that much unless they are too good or too bad. However, here too, I find that the sound gets annoying if the volume is too high and I cannot eat while watching because it amplifies the sound of my jaw too much. Plus it makes everything sound a little weird. But I guess the last part gets adjusted with use.\n\nAll in all, I will try a different pair next time. I mainly checked the reviews and bought them because they were rated high on durability. If they break soon, then there will be no point in me ever buying them again. I will see how long they last."", ""Felt like Cheap Chinese Headphones in some nice packing.\n\nGo for Sennheiser, I wasn't able to wear then single day.\n\nPro - So Loud at full they can even bleed your ears too.\n\nCons\n- High bass driven outshines the highs and the mids ( Vocals lie deep down that boom boom)\n- Not that comfortable to wear.\n- even design is So called hawk but it is not if comfort is considered.\n\nChoice is Yours."", 'Worst product ever.

Fit - Requires some getting used to, but i managed to it fit it properly to feel the music\n2. Sound quality - Ok, so if you remove the price factor, these headphones are no better than low end skullcandy ones. Bass reproduction is limited to mostly thumping. You won\'t get much of that deep harmonic bass. Maybe, for this price, this is what you get. Don\'t get lured by the price, if you want great sound quality, go for the higher end ones.', 'No need to waste one\'s money on expensive headphones unless you need it for a super specialized reason. These are wonderful earphones with good design, excellent sound quality and class A packaging (includes a transparent bag to securely keep the earphones as well). For once, this is truly a case of paying for the ""brand-name"" only if you are purchasing any other when these are available. I want to thank and encourage such companies which are demonstrating that good stuff can be made available to people at large without exorbitant pricing.', 'Please dont buy this trash product, it did not last even for 2 months. I am a very light user and used this for my online classes but headphone is very cheap quality. After 40 days, left side of headphone stopped working, two days after it the right side volume decreased very low and then right side also stopped working. Boat is a very bad company, that is only doing false marketing and i think it just repackages cheap, rejected stuff from China and sells it here calling.', ""The sound quality is sub-standard. Quite disappointed to hear static when the earphones move even slightly. The wires also seem cheap and thin compared to Mi earphones that I used previously.\n\nUPDATE - Demoting from 2 star rating I gave initially to 1 star now. It's not even been 5 months and the left earphone stopped working. I've kept it extra careful these past months because the wires felt very flimsy. My old Mi headphones lasted for 1.5 years and I had to replace them only because my cat ripped one of the earphones. Otherwise it was working great! Never going to buy these again! Also, the ends of the earphones are really quite sharp. Not fun to get poked by them often. The all-round horrible quality is literally adding insult to injury. I don't see why they have to be pretentious and say the original price is 999 and that we get these at a discounted price. üôÑ"", ""Pros:\n1. Crystal clear voice.\n2. Good mic, the person on the other side gets to gear sound without any noise.\n3. Tangle-free cord/wire. The length of the cord/wire is okay (not too long or too short)\n4. The earpiece fits comfortably in your ear, I could wear it for hours while listening to Audio Books without any discomfort.\n5. The product looks and feels sturdy.\n6. The Cors/wire comes with a nice removable velcro strap.\n7. Speakers of the headphone produce good bass.\n\nCons:\n1. It is strange, but the product doesn't have any clamp to stick its wire on your shirt. I am habitual of sticking the microphone to my shirt while using the headphones, now without the clamp, the microphone hangs freely touching arbitrary surfaces that creates knocking sound for the person on the other side.\n\nFinal Word:\nIt is a good product at the right price point, people who are serious about sound quality and are budget-strapped can feel free to go for it.""]"

If you are music lover and interested in listening each minute details of the music, this is not the ideal piece."", ' Boat bassheads 102 is definitely a value for money product, cant judge these with other earphones outthere because for the price it is really a good earphones to buy, sound is really nice and quality is ok for its price, wire is thin its a little fragile, but if it lasts 6 months it is more than enough', ""Made with really cheap plastic not at all attractive when you receive, if you're Pubg lover except the footsetep of your enemy, you'll get to hear everything around you and get killed sooner. Apart from gaming, no music lover should buy this. Absolute disgusting, low sound and bass quality while you're listening on YouTube and on any other app of music except music you'll only get to hear that dub dub dub bassy sound which will irritate you.\n\nP.S: Do not buy this earphone."", 'I have more than 5 boat products at my home and all are working fine. So can say that boat is a great brand for audio/ music Equipments.\n\nI use these earphones for taking office calls on my laptop. The sound quality is good with adequate noise cancellation. Cannot ask for great music and bass output as these are basic entry level earphones but do their work absolutely fine.\n\nIf you want to use these for listening to music then I would say spend a bit more on higher range boat products.', 'Excellent than what I expected it to be. The magnet on earbuds and cable organizing sticker thing is nice. All I wanted was a cheap headset which does not let people hear my background noise while on meeting calls. And it works exactly the same way I wanted. Happy with the purchase', ""Reason for low rating is that the product worked fine for only 5 months. Post the same, jack started malfunctioning. I have to keep rotating the jack in phone / laptop to get proper voice/volume. I have applied for warranty replacement and hope to get the same replaced. Will Post next update regarding the replacement process.\n\nEarphone is otherwise very comfortable on the ear. I have used on both phone as well as laptop\n\nUpdate: received new headphones set from boat 2 days back. It's a higher version and color which I'm happy with as long as it works fine."", ""This is a perfect product for thise who are looking to use earphones for regular use. Be it watching your videos, taking your calls peacefully or enjoying your music. The quality of audio is better than most in the same price range and frankly, I have been nothing but happy after buying these at a price range that I did.\nSo, if you don't have a very specific type of audio experience in mind and can be happy with better than decent, this is a good product for you.\nI personally thiught that it surpassed my expectations. Thae wires don't tangle much and even if they do, they are easy to detangle. Earphones have been working perfectly even after some rough handling. My brother sleeps with then buried under him every night and any other low quality product would have suffered wire damage by now. So, this much is my proof that the product is genuine and worth your money. Go for it!"", ""This is my 6th time buying boat earphone all for myself one after another. The sound quality is great for the price however the audio quality seems to disappear or one or the other side of the earpiece seems to stop working after 6-7 months. I never bothered to contact service centre even though it's still under warranty simply because the price is too low for me to waste time dealing with customer care but it's my 6th boat earphone and I finally decided to write this review. I can't wear headphones coz it makes me sweat alot so I go for earphones only even while I'm gaming on pc or listening to music on my mobile device. The sound quality has been great but my concern is with the build materials that wears out after prolong use even though there is no physical damage. The left or the right side of the earpiece cease to work and audio volume declines too low to the point I have to turn up to full volume to hear anything. Thanks for 4-5 years of my earphone experience with Boat but I will be moving on to another brand with better build material. Hopefully boat improves it too in that department. Until then ciao"", 'boAt BassHeads 102 Wired Earphones received in good condition. Its really amazing sound quality and bass sound also terrible. I recommend to all.

Even in voice calls the quality is very good.\nThe bass quality is dope. You can feel every beat. Try listening rap on it. It's just perfect.\nNoise cancellation is decent.\nPerfect for gaming also.\nThe physical appearance of the bass heads is super cool. I got the blue one, it looks plain stunning. Plus the cover of the bass heads is designed well."", ""This is my fifth boat earphones. I did an analysis of my order history on Amazon and realised that I have been buying these earohone every 5 months or so. That's how long they last which is not great value for your money! Don't fall for the heavy discounts and invest your money in earphones that will last much longer than 5 months."", ""Extremely poor quality, after exact 30 days of delivery, the voice is now so low that it not audible.\nStreet side shop may be capable to provide better quality than this one.\nPlz don't want your money, better to donate it in place of buying this product."", 'Its going to be 1 year since I purchased this product but I am disappointed with the quality of the material and warranty service support by Boat. The wire next to inbuilt mic junction broke and the earphone stopped working.\nI am not able to raise service request from Boat website because of their website technical error. So there is no way I can claim the warranty even though product stopped working within 1 year of warranty period', ""I have been using this earphone for almost a month now and impressed with it's performance. When I first started using the earphones the eartips were little big for me, so I had to swap them for a smaller eartip which comes included in the pack. During the initial phase of using the earphones, it was uncomfortable, my ears were hurting for some reason but after a week it went normal and it was comfortable. I think after a while you get used to the earphones.\n\nFor gaming purposes I will NOT recommend these earphones at all. They are very bad for gaming. If you are looking for an audio device for gaming then save your money and go for a gaming headset or earphone.\n\nHere are the pros and cons that I have encountered:\nPros:\n1. Amazing sound quality for the price you paying\n2. Mic quality is decent, for attending online classes or meetings\n3. Comes with extra eartips(small and large)\n4. L shaped audio jack\n5. Magnetic earpieces, helps the earphones to not get tangled\n6. Warranty\n7. Gold plated audio jack\n\nCons:\n1. During initial usage the earphones may feel uncomfortable. For me personally my ear was hurting but after a week I got used to it and it was comfortable\n2. Length of the wire is a little short, I prefer a longer wire.\n3. Not ideal for gaming\n\nOverall it is a good earphone for the price you are paying for it. You can't expect anything more in this price range.\nIf you listen to music, attend meetings/classes then go for this earphone blindly"", ""Many boat products available in the market but this one is something which you can buy with no hesitation. Although, the build quality could have been better but there isn't any issues with the sound quality.\nOf course at this price range, we cannot expect high bass and perfect noise cancellation but this can be used while you are struck in an office meeting."", ""This wired earphone is quite good in performance. Honestly I was skeptical about its quality/performance. But I'm pleasantly surprised by the sound quality it offers. The noise cancellation feature is mediocre at most though. The magnetic earbuds are a plus at this price. Overall performance is quite satisfactory. Recommended!"", 'Updated after using 1 month: The earphones are good for music. Means, decent base and sound quality. The issue is with voice calls. You hear voice with some jhankar. Mic is not sensitive. The ""Y"" structure of the cables keep the mic away from the mouth. I tried using a clip and kept the mic near 2nd button of the shirt but people on the other side were complaining of low voice. You need to hold mic with 1 hand to keep it near the chin.\n\nComfortable in ears and block the noise just like any other earphones with silicon tops. Overall, 4/5 rating.', ""Sound quality of Product 'boAt Bassheads 102 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic' is very good. When I used it for Karaoke singing, sound quality was not excellent as per my observation. It could be a limitation on the performance of MIC while used for such activities. For normal usage it is very good (for calls etc)."", ""For the pricing it's actually very decent. Good mids, treble is all little low but bass is okay. If you are looking for just using it to talk then it's okay but if you want good sounding earpiece for music and video games, i won't recommend this. The product fe√©ls very cheap but it's quite light which is a good thing. You get extra air cups in case the size don't fit you. About three extra pairs."", ""Sound quality is same as boat 225. Lightweight but I donot find them much comfortable to wear. Ears can start paining. I even tried changing the ears buds, still feels like something is left. On the other hand 225 was better. But yes you will get some clear and louder sound in 102 and laterally reversible earplugs. It's a good buy and definitely worth money."", 'Well as the name suggests, this headset is for bassheads. I on the other hand am much more used to a flattersound profile. With that said here are some pros and cons\n\nPros:\n- The sound signature is more leaned towards the bass side.\n- The vocals and mid range are clear for a bass heavy headset.\n- The headset has an L type connector so easier to connect to your phones and keep it in your pocket with worrying about damaging the jack\n\nCons:\n- The headset length is unacceptably short at least for me.\n- The bass sound is the once that sounds muddied up in some songs. I compared the bass performance of this headset with a Sony MDR-XB50BS and this headset did not have impressive bass clarity (the bass is still punchy tho).', 'I have been using this product from just a couple of days ago and this was my first boat purchase. This earphone has a decent and a simple look which is nice. It also serves a very good bass. Mic and control button are perfect and wire length is also good. Although it is a good product but the problem is about the jack and buds fitting. Jack is little bit loose for my Galaxy J7 as sometimes it does not works as it get twist and turn. Another one is about buds. It is quiet loose so it comes out easily.', 'I purchased this neckband style Bluetooth earphones without much expectations, more like a low cost alternative to carry to the gym. BOY o BOY! This is one of those products which are a hidden gem in the midst of many trashy (and more expensive) earbuds. Bass, clarity and volume are excellent, and at par in some respects to my 5 times more expensive SONY branded wireless earbuds with noise cancellation and all. This is one headset which is pure value for money, and definitely a MUST buy. Enjoy your Boat!', 'Average product! Dont expect too much, using them give me the feeling of ancient days when single wired earphone were introduced. Moreover, they neither inear fit nor outside earfit, keep falling. Use some tapes and glue them on to your ears to stop them falling with every move. Good for practicing ""Statue"" game.', 'Sound Quality is very good especially while listening Music, but feels low sound in any other multimedia like listening YouTube videos etc.\nBass and Noise Cancellation is just Ok.\nAnd also fitting is not appropriate, feels slipping from ear and also feels Uncomfortable while wearing for little bit long time.\nDesign and Look of Earphone and Box both is fantastic.', ""When it worked , it was great, issue came when both the earbuds stopped working, within 3 months . luckily before the warranty ran out figured out that you could book via online, a pickup of the bad product , hence gave it a shot ..The process itself worked , while the intent is there on their part to achieve customer satisfaction, it seems to be lost in translation , they replaced my broken earphones with some other used / old earphones ...Do they think it's hygienic to plug someone else's earphone into your ears ?!! Not buying any of their products ever again\n\nPros :\n\nFree home pickup of the product without having to visit any service centre\nGreat tracking and constant update via email /SMS on the status\nReplacement product sent via courier.\n\nCons :\nAs they say, devil is in the details - since it was in warranty and I guess they couldn't repair it , they sent a replacement earphones in a ziplock cover ( unsealed) , the product sent as replacement was not the same model , did not have original packaging and looked very old and extensively used !! Would I be plugging them.into my ears ? Hell no !! Off they go into the dustbin and this brand is off my list for any future purchases"", ""I feel that the sound quality is good as compared to Boat 100, more bass, good for bass lovers. The build quality is good, only plastic and no metal. The only con is that the fitting becomes loose once you wear for some time and you have to us refit those. Won't recommend for those who plan to wear these during exercise, yoga, running, or cycling. Best for use while being stationary."", ""It's an absolute delight to use this earphone. The fact that boat gives 2 extra pair of rubber pads and a small carry bag for the earphones, adds to the glory. The sound quality is amazing and outside noise is almost nill. All of this at a very decent price. Another feature in the cap is that it's an Indian company."", ""Good quality earphones at this price. I've been using boAt earphones for 4-5 years now.. the ones in this range usually last 1-1.5 yrs (I do not handle them roughly or tug at them).\nThe color is very pretty. I even got a small black storage pouch but the material sticks to the holding velcro on the earphones. Also, the pouch leaves minute dust threads on the earbuds. Hence, I might end up using the pouch for something else.\nBut overall, the purchase was worth it"", 'So, I have been using this for a month now and till now, I have not met with a problem. So, as per my experience:\n\nSound Quality- Outstanding. No problem with the quality. No cracking or echoing.\n\nBass Quality- Not as Good as promised, but acceptable.\n\nSound Clarity- Wonderful. You can hear every word the person on the other side says in a call. (Until your bandwidth is low)\n\nProduct Quality- Not as expected but better! These are truly intangible wires, thanks to the magnets, with attractive colors. The microphone is at a desirable place and works exceptionally well. The fitting is good.\n\nConclusion: If you are taking this for meetings and classes, I doubt you will find a better choice, though it is not the best if you want this for hearing and vibing to music. I will suggest Oraimo Vortex for such purpose.', ""There is constant noise and one side stops working after 6 months. Now you might think there are 2 years of warranty to get it replaced, but that's a complete scam too. They take 30-45 days to replace the item if you stay anywhere outside Mumbai. That's plain ridiculous. There is no way it takes 15 days for the product to reach Mumbai from Bhubaneswar. It took 3 days for an amazing delivery from a seller at Mumbai to Bhubaneswar. They even take 7 days to dispatch the product even after the replacement is issued. The 2 years of warranty are there because they know noone is going to claim it since noone has that much time to wait for. And guess what the replacement stops working after 6-7 months too."", ""Reviewing after a year of daily usage as I'm WFH. Still working the same way they came in a year ago. Have dropped them and snagged them a few times but it hasn't affected the performance.\n\nDon't expect stupendous noise cancellation or audiophile level bass at this price point. They are good for everyday usage and that's what matters."", ""I went for it because I needed a cheap earphone urgently. Thought it would be better than the unbranded or fake ones we get outside. But it turned out to be a bad decision.\nFirstly the sound quality is poor. And by poor I really mean poor. And why call it bassheads when it doesn't have any. Worse than the regular earphones that come along with your phone.\nThen is the build quality. Made up of plastic which is ok. But the earbud silicone tips fall apart within a few days of use.\nLastly the mic is the worst part I found in these earphones. For some reason they pick out all kinds of noises even if you speak directly into the microphone. It's so bad that the other person can never hear what you say clearly.\nOverall it's a poor pair of earphones, certainly not worth 300."", ""The build quality is good for the affordable price. The sound is crystal clear.\nThe only issue I found was that the ear phones doesn't fit properly in the ears and keeps falling. You will have to spend more time in adjusting the ear phones than the actual purpose!"", 'Bought for 399/- and found reasonable for its price range. Brought especially for office call by connecting to laptop most of the time.\nWith the buds in the ears, so external sound is heard which is good. However I hear my voice more internally in my head while talking.\n\nRest all good. I like the magnet sticking two buds, mic placement and the strap to bundle the earphone for storing.\nWorth 399/-', ""I'm allready using infinity glide 500, wireless headphone.

They look good and he can't hear backgrnd noise when he has these earphones on.\nBut quality is like all earphones nothing special here"", 'The build quality is so poor. This was my 3rd or 4th Boat headphones. They get malfunctioning within months. They keep on decreasing sound of music by themselves especially while running. Apart from that, the internal wires are so pathetic that sound stops in one or both earphone', 'Sound quality is good for the price. There is no screeching at loud volume. Noise cancellation is moderately good considering their plug in earphones. Bass is ok. It looks very sleek and has a beautiful blue colour. The wire is tangle free and i like that the earphones have magnets so both stay together in place. The package is very well marketed with a cutely packaged little box containing celeb signatures. All in all very funky and ‚Äú It‚Äôs In ‚Äú', '1.Really nice sound quality.\n2. The bass is a bit on lower side, if going for bass - basshead152 variant is a much better option.\n3. Blue colour is kinda really bright. It looks like a matte finish.\n4. Good for small ears, fits snuggly.\n5. Notice cancellation is really good. (mostly cuz of the snug fitting)\n6. Multifunction control button is durable. (size - a bit on smaller side though)', ""Considering the price range of this model of the earphone, you are getting a good deal out of it. The earphones are super light on ears and the sound quality is great. Add on benefit is that the earbuds have magnets which gives you hassle free experience and causes no detangling. The earphones also comes with 3 pairs of extra buds which one can use depending upon the ear size that fits you. Or if u are clumsy and careless like me and keep losing the earbuds for no particular reason, these extra earbuds serves u as a Back up.\nOver all, I'd recommend this product as worth the price that you are paying for."", 'Using it with OnePlus 6. They work good on music/video content but voice clarity during calls is not there. Got them replaced once but same problem persists. Noise cancellation not there at all. Not expected from Boat. Looks like a waste of money.', ""It's not a good set of earphones, considering what I've heard about boat from my friends. It might be good for listening to music, but I bought it for calls and the sound feels kind of muffled (probably because of the bass). The mic doesn't detect your voice; you'll have to hold it near to your mouth to speak. And the earplugs don't stay in your ears at all. I have changed all sizes of the plugs and tried, but they stay only if I don't move. I'm having to use my older JBL ones again now. I don't know why any noise cancellation is mentioned. That seems like a false claim.\n\nBottomline: Don't putchase it.""]"

Also its just straight like rod without any tilt to adjust with ear angle unlike most earphones which do come with little tilt to easily fit in ears."", 'This is my second boat headphones, and they have the same issue. The extra pieces of ear cover do not fit the diameter of the headphones. so if you lose the original piece, the headphones are pretty much useless. I thought it was an issue only with my first headphones but the new ones have the same problem. Can the manufacturer help?', ""I have used boat products previously and suddenly all my friends have started recommending me Boat‚Äôs products. I work in the Film industry where the sound is one of the most essential elements and no matter whether you have or have not, a good earphone is a must.\n\nApple gives good earphones but they break after a while but the sound quality they provide is excellent. The problem is that first, they are super expensive and second, they don't last long.\n\nMost other earphones in the same range will give far inferior product and their sound quality is so bad that it will only damage your eardrums and give your headaches. Here is a detailed view of why I find the Boat earphones to be one of\nthe best that there is ‚Äì\n\n------\n\nPros\n\n\uf0a7 If you are ordering from Amazon, then you have a well packed good product in your hands. I have also found that I am unable to find the Boat products easily in the general market.\n\uf0a7 Wires are like strap, flat and very strong. Unlike earphones which gives you a rubbery feeling, these earphones will give you more of a plastic feeling.\n\uf0a7 The wire does not coil itself and if it does, it is easy to open it because of the of the smooth strapped flat shape of wires.\n\uf0a7 The sound is amazing. It does not break even when I took the volume a little higher.\n\uf0a7 They are easily stuck on ears and does not fall off.\n\uf0a7 The wire is long enough for you to put laptop one side and watch movies from a distance.\n\uf0a7 The microphone is also awesome as I sang songs and made voice notes, for which it was clear and precise. Sometimes more than required. It even captured my breathing sound from a distance.\n\uf0a7 The earbuds have a metallic look and are strong. There is no question you have to buy another earphone for an entire year.\n\uf0a7 It comes with an entire set of different custom earbud covers. It helps because different people have different ear sizes and according to them they can use it for their ears. It also comes with cervical ear support which helps in putting an earbud to connect more impactfully to your ear without giving you pain. It helps if you don‚Äôt want earbuds to fall in case of strong movements.\n\uf0a7 Most important, though the price is less, the boat products do not look very cheap and boasts of a good brand name.\n\n------\n\nCons\n\n\uf0a7 Are you kidding me? Till now there are no cons for me. With the price tag attached to it, it is literally the best bargain you can get on an earphone. My brother has two of them in different colours and loves them.\n\n------\n\nFinal Opinion\n\nDon‚Äôt think twice before ordering it. There are tremendously good reviews all over for Boat products and lately, I have seen more and more people leaning towards this product. I cannot tell you how many people have recommended me this earphone and those friends of mine have never faced any problem of any kind.\n\nWithout a doubt, the best company that there is today on Amazon. If you are planning to buy it, do it. You won't regret it.\n\n------"", ""Pros:\nGood build quality.\nEarpieces are metallic build, strong build and excellent fit and finish.\nFlat type tangle-free wires which are strong enough to withstand rough handling.\n90-degree bend pin helps a lot while using with any smartphone kept in hip-pocket.\nCompatibility with many smartphone brands.\nThe earpieces have excellent fit in the ear-canal, resulting in almost 100% ambient noise cancellation.\nCons:\n1. IMHO - the metallic earpieces are a bit little too heavy, they tend to fall off the ear due to their own weight, if the earpieces are kept a little loosely (to allow me to listen to somebody sitting next to me, or be aware of ambient sounds while driving through bad traffic and have to take a call).\n2. If I try to fit them tightly in the ear-canal so that they won't fall off easily, then another problem arises - the lowest volume in my Mi Note 5 Pro sounds TOO LOUD for my ears! Since I cannot reduce the phone's volume any more, I have to keep the earpieces a little loose in the ear canal. And then they tend to fall off again, due to their weight and the loose fit. Maybe this is a compatibility issue with this particular phone model Mi Note 5 Pro ?"", 'Excellent headphones..100% VFM headphones from Boat...\nMaterial quality: Very good quality headphones. Ear pieces are sturdy, rubbers are soft ,good quality wires,tangle free flat wires..\nDesign: A personal variable..but i think it looks cool..but a little bit on the heavier side due to those metallic inserts on ear piece.\nMic : Good quality mic, with in line controls. Provides a decent call clarity. Decent noise cancellation, though not the perfect.\nSOUND : Its really a great headphone for its price,especially when we consider the sound quality. I felt ,its too loud when compared to other good quality headphones. Trebles and mids are excellent. Bass is so good, but mind you dont conpare it with an xtrabass(sony). But for the price its giving excellent bass.\nOverall, except the loudness, its a superb buy at this price point...\nI would say, if u love bass n quality, in a below 600 rs range these are the best to go for.\nIf u have little more budget,to get a balanced music, go for JBLc200si..If u want deep powerfull bass,quality n have a well stretched budget, go for Sony XB55 or Seinheiser cx275s', 'CONS: The sound is horrible, it does not capture the most basic frequency range properly. If you are into guitar based music like Rock and Metal, then this is going to disappoint you. The bass is middy and does not cover the low end properly, the mids sound scooped, the treble falls short of its full range. It also has a very phony surround sound which makes it harder to hear what is really playing. The earphones fail to do what they are intended for.\nPROS: The material and the overall quality is nice, the earphones are sturdy. The packet also comes with superfluous accessories, so no issue there.', ""This is not original!! It's first copy of boAt 225\n.... Original is available only on Myntra"", ""Very disappointed with customer service and the warranty conditions. I'd replaced the product within 1 year warranty & the replaced started malfunctioning within 3 months. BoAt's representative are saying that replacement of replaced product is against their policy, this emerges a doubt whether the replacement was original or refurbished.\n\nRegarding the product, the sound quality is amazing, the noise cancellation is good, a very bass for bass lovers but the piece is little heavy, so you might find it a little uncomfortable but so are the other earphones.\n\nI've recommended few of my friends for this product or other products from BoAt as I find it an amazing piece apart from the customer service at this price."", ""The sound is fuller than most products in this range, the volume is intense and can never push it to full because it gets too loud. You can wear them on a bike with helmet on and in a gym environment where loud music is already playing in the background as this drown out everything. They're not sweatproof or water resistant so be careful. Any sweat will disrupt the earphone and might render the mic useless. The earphones are extremely comfy, the extra ear tips are in various sizes therefore can fit almost all ears. I replaced the stock with the smaller ones for a snug and comfy fit that doesn't pain after prolonged use. The wire is actually tangle free and the build quality is overall satisfactory even sturdy. The downside and the reason why I'm not giving it 4 stars is that the mic stopped working 1 day after my return to amazon date expired. So within a week the mic went kaput. Just won't work."", 'Listen , all the zist and proper points. I am reviewing it after 1year over.and still working good.\n1. The packaging quality is superb.\n2. Low budget nice headphone.\n3.

Deep and punchier coz its freq.response is tood good comore to other brands. But you might found the clarity is bit less as compare to JBL, SEINHEISSER, SONY. There is noise little bit.\n6. The mic was preety decent before but now it works bt still other person over the phone gets very disturbed coz it creates lots of noise., dnt know why.\n7. Last, I will say.. U can go for it without hesitation, if ur range is within 500 to 600.', 'For a moderate users it is very good but not for Only listing High quality of music.\n1) Build Quality is Very Good, tangle free wire and metal Ear pods.\n2) Ear buds are really good and there are various type of spare ear buds provide which really nice for different ear.\n3) Good quality of Pouch provided (optional) for carry and keep safe.\n4) Mic quality is very good and notice cancellation is nice refined,\nonly cons is only single button for mute and unmute mic, no other button for change music.', ""The earphones are pretty good. It gives a decent sound output with quite a good amount of bass. People saying the bass isn't good have definately damaged their eardrums already so don't fall for their words.\nThe discomforts I felt was as the earphones are little heavy so I have to use hooks so that they don't fell out from my ear but plonged use of the earphones (little over one hour) make me uncomfortable. Secondly the jack is 90 degrees bent so if the phone is my pocket while I am riding my bike, a little twist in the jack causes it to disconnect from phone."", ""For someone who wouldn't bother even visiting the product listing again, I am forced to write this review.\n\nLet me put the record straight, this has to be one of THE BEST headphones in its category for sure! I've never used a Sony, JBL or Sennheiser before, but I could confidently bet my money on boAT for sure.\n\nTo begin with, the BASS! It not only vibrates the innermost part of your ears but can potentially blow your skull away.....literally!\n\nI had purchased the Motorola Pulse Escape (Bluetooth) headphones for around Rs 3000/- and could not have been happier to have exchanged them for this pair.\n\nFor under Rs 500/- this is an absolute steal!

Its more than enough for regular usage and light gaming as well.\nThe only con I would say is that they could have included previous song button alongwith the play/pause button. I am not deducting any stars for this one, it's only I wish it had.\n\nNote: many people say that its heay as its made of metal and falls of often. For that problem they have included the silicon hooks which comes with the box itself you just need to attach thise silicon hooks and they would stick to your ears for eternity."", 'Dear Audiophiles,\nLet me start with saying you that if you are spotify/gaana/Wink users, please pay and upgrade your account.

In that context I must say this headset is pretty ok. There is too much hype for Bass of this headset but I found it below the bass of JBL. In this headset Above 70 percentage volume, bass dominantes vocals which in turn results in a situation where you cant catch the lyrics of song.
