I was looking for a laptop with entry level processor with SSD, 8GB ram and 15.6"" display. This one came close. Except for the 8 GB ram, it has everything else. Ram can be upgraded later on.\n\nThis laptop is good for:\n1. All \'view\' activities like browsing internet, online shopping, emails etc\n2. Video calls for online schooling provided you won\'t use virtual background.\n3. Basic office documents like Word, Excel and PowerPoint, PDF documents\n4. Use in a non air-conditioned room as low end processor don\'t generate too much heat\n5. Basic software programming\n6. Watch videos, play music\n7. Basic multitasking as Windows will take up most of the RAM. I was looking for 8 GB ram for this reason.\n\nThis laptop is not good for:\n1. Gaming as processor is too slow.\n2. \'Create\' activities involving processor intensive tasks such video editing, CAD drawings, graphics, photo editing, animations etc.\n3. Heavy programming like AI or ML algorithms\n4. Running lots of background services and utilities that improve user experience but hog the resources\n5. multitasking when too many programs are running together. If you normally open more than 10 tabs on your browser, you may need more RAM.\n6. If you need a lot of disk space for large files. This machine as 256GB SSD but you can also add a separate 1TB HDD so this should not be a limitation.\n\nFew good points\nDell power manager allows you to stop charging the battery at 55%. This will extend life of the battery.\nThin and light, good for portability.\nHinges appear to be solid.\nNot a lot of bloatware from Dell. Most of the bloatware can be uninstalled easily.\nOffice H&S 2019 is available. I don\'t see any 30 day license note anywhere. Will wait and watch. If it works after 30 days, that\'s a big plus.\n\nFew bad points\nCamera and display quality is average. With a screen size of 15.6"" and a resolution of 1366x764, sometimes you do see some pixilation. Most of the time, it\'s just fine.\n\nThe only limitation I see is that there is only 1 RAM slot so I have to throw away the 4 Gb chip and replace it with 8 Gb. I generally avoid throwing away working parts but that\'s the only option I have. 8 GB is also the max the motherboard can handle so once I exceed that I will have to buy a new laptop. It was actually hard to find if other machines with similar specs have 1 slot or 2 slots so I am assuming most machines in this price range comes with one SODIMM slot.', ""The laptop is light weight with not much powerful processor, but the best part is due to SSD the boot-up and shutdown time is 1-2 seconds. All the applications are working smoothly. Laptop comes with 1 Year Dell basic warranty, Genuine Windows 10 which needs to be activated, MS office 2019 student subscription and 15 Months McAfee antivirus subscription. Battery life is good and with moderate use can last upto 5 hrs.
