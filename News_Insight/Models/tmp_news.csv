Thousands without power, planes delayed as storm Bella lashes France
"," Tens of thousands were left without electricity and planes were delayed or forced to re-route Sunday as storm Bella caused torrential rain and heavy winds in much of France. Brittany and Normandy in the north and west of France were the first regions to suffer power cuts, but “18,000 households were reconnected” later on Sunday, said power company Enedis.  However, some 34,000 households in the east and centre of France were still without power as the storm made its way across the country.  Over a third of flights from France’s main airport of Charles de Gaulle north of Paris had suffered delays of an average of 50 minutes due to the storm. However, airport operator ADP said “air traffic has now returned to normal”.  Three flights heading to the airport were re-routed to Paris Orly airport south of Paris, while an Aeroflot flight landed in Amsterdam and a plane heading from Luxemburg turned back. A top flight rugby clash between Pau and Stade Francais scheduled for the afternoon was delayed by three hours after the storm prevented the Paris-based team from taking off. The winds and rains abated in some areas by the late afternoon, but heavy snow was forecast on higher ground in the south of the country heading into Monday. Similar troubles were seen in the south of England where winds reaching 170 kilometres (105 miles) an hour were recorded on the Isle of Wight overnight Saturday to Sunday.  Meanwhile some 20,000 households in Wales had their electricity cut while delays were also seen on railways due to trees falling on the line.",thehindu

SII to launch first indigenous pneumonia vaccine ","The first indigenous vaccine against pneumonia, developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII), will be launched by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday, says information released by the Institute here on Sunday. According to sources, the vaccine will be much more affordable than the existing ones manufactured by two foreign companies.  In July, India’s drug regulator had granted market approval for the Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate vaccine, after reviewing the phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trial data submitted by the Pune-based firm.  “This vaccine is used for active immunisation against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia in infants,” the Health Ministry had said earlier.",thehindu

Central Africa votes in polls marred by violence
"," Voters went to the polls on Sunday in the Central African Republic in presidential and legislative elections marred by the latest flare-up in a long-running civil war, with many voters unable to cast their ballots. Incumbent Faustin Archange Touadera is the frontrunner in polls that follow a week of turbulence marked by accusations of an attempted coup, rebels briefly seizing the fourth-largest town and Russia and Rwanda dispatching military personnel to help the beleaguered government. UN peacekeepers and local and Rwandan soldiers were patrolling the streets of the capital on Sunday with armoured vehicles posted outside polling stations. Although some stations opened late in Bangui because of a lack of voting materials, senior election officials told AFP they would stay open later to make up for it. “It’s very important for me to be here, as a citizen. I think this vote will change our country, whoever the president will be,” teacher Hortense Reine said. Sixteen candidates are vying for the presidency — Touadera’s main rival is former prime minister Anicet Georges Dologuele. Polling stations began to close at 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) with partial results expected on January 4 and the final totals on January 19. At the end of the day, government spokesman Ange Maxime Kazagui praised “the commitment and determination of the population who defied the armed groups”. And Momokoama Theophile of the National Elections Authority (ANE) told AFP that turnout had been good “despite minor security concerns in some places”.  A runoff will be held on February 14 if there is no overall majority in the first round. Away from Bangui, sporadic fighting has been going on for nine days and scattered incidents were reported early on Sunday. In the northwest, more than 500 kilometres (300 miles) from the capital, rebels seized election materials in Koui and officials received death threats in Ngaoundaye, according to a senior UN official.  In some areas, rebels threatened anyone who went to vote.  The CSSE Strategic Committee for Securing Elections, which is close to the government, listed at least 12 provincial sub-prefectures where voting could not take place.  Meanwhile, thousands of people had not received their voter cards because of the dire security situation, according to local and UN officials who all requested anonymity. “How do we vote when we don’t even have our voter cards,” Robert, from Boali 80 kilometres north of Bangui told AFP by phone -- explosions audible in the background. “Everyone is fleeing at the moment. I’m holed up at home.”  Ahead of the elections many of the 1,500 candidates contesting the 140 seats in the national assembly were unable to campaign. Former president Francois Bozize, who wanted to stand but was barred by judges because he is under UN sanctions, urged people not to vote and backed a rebel coalition. “Stay at home. Let Touadera place his ballot in the box alone,” Bozize said in an audio message published online which his party confirmed to AFP. The government on December 19 accused Bozize of attempting a coup alongside armed groups advancing on the capital, a charge he denies. Fears about the rebels swept the city in the following days, although the UN peacekeeping force MINUSCA said their advance had been stopped. The rebel coalition on Wednesday announced a 72-hour “unilateral ceasefire” in the runup to the vote, only to call it off on Friday saying it would resume its march on the capital.  On Tuesday, the CAR’s fourth-largest town, Bambari, 380 kilometres northeast of Bangui, was overrun but security forces backed by UN peacekeepers regained control the following day. On Sunday, polling stations in Bambari remained closed in the morning because of gunfire from armed groups, according to Jeannot Nguernendji, president of the local peace committee.  The mineral-rich but poverty-stricken CAR has been unstable since independence 60 years ago. Thousands of people have died since a civil war erupted in 2013 and more than a quarter of the population of 4.9 million have fled their homes. Of these, 675,000 are refugees in neighbouring countries and cannot vote. Even though bloodshed has receded in intensity over the last two years, violence remains chronic. Militia groups hold sway over two-thirds of the territory. Experts and opposition figures have already asked what legitimacy the president and 140 MPs to be elected will have, given the obstacles to holding a free vote.",thehindu

Premier League | Late Wolves equaliser extends Spurs slump
"," Tottenham paid for an overly conservative approach from Jose Mourinho as Romain Saiss’s equaliser four minutes from time earned Wolves a 1-1 draw at Molineux on Sunday. Spurs made a dream start as Tanguy Ndombele opened the scoring in the first minute. But Mourinho’s men have now failed to win in four consecutive league games to heavily dent their hopes of a first league title in 60 years.  Tottenham edge up to fifth, but remain six points adrift of leaders Liverpool. Saiss’s late leveller was no less than Wolves deserved as they dominated the second-half. But it was a familiar story for Spurs as just like in blowing another two points in a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace a fortnight ago, they sat on a precarious 1-0 lead for most of the match and were punished. Tottenham started like a side keen to make amends for last weekend’s lacklustre 2-0 defeat to Leicester. The visitors could even have scored before they did as Son Heung-min’s shot from a narrow angle was blocked behind. From the resulting corner, the ball broke to Ndombele at the edge of the box and his shot deceived Rui Patricio, who should have done better in the Wolves goal. Wolves have struggled for goals since losing Raul Jimenez to a fractured skull last month. The Mexican was at Molineux for the first time since his injury, but his presence was missed on the field as the hosts went onto dominate possession without a cutting edge. Fabio Silva flashed a shot into the side-netting and Daniel Podence fired too close to Hugo Lloris from the edge of box before the break. Nuno Espirito Santo’s men have made a habit of scoring the bulk of their goals in the second-half and looked like the only side capable of scoring after the break. Silva’s claims for a soft penalty were waived away as Tottenham largely restricted the hosts to potshots from range. Ruben Neves curled narrowly over before Wolves’ danger man Pedro Neto saw another effort from the edge of the area deflected just wide. Neto was the provider when Wolves did score the goal their second-half performance deserved. Saiss beat his marker to a corner at the near post and flicked the ball into the far corner. Wolves should even have gone on to win the game when 18-year-old Silva wasted a golden chance for his first Premier League goal from open play with a header straight at Lloris deep in stoppage time.",thehindu

Land row: Intellectuals protest against treatment meted out to Sen by Visva-Bharati
"," Intellectuals of various fields on Sunday took part in a protest to express their support to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen on the row over his family being in “illegal” possession of land at Visva-Bharati, and denounced the “dictatorial and autocratic” conduct of the central university towards him. Poets Joy Goswami and Subodh Sarkar, singer Kabir Suman, painters Jogen Chowdhury and Suvaprasanna, theatre personality-turned-minister Bratya Basu and others assembled at the compound of the Academy of Fine Arts here to raise their voice on the issue. They were holding placards saying “Will not accept BJP’s insult to Bengalis”, “Insult to Amartya Sen is insult to Bengalis”. Visva-Bharati has recently written to the West Bengal government claiming that dozens of land parcels owned by it were wrongfully recorded in the names of private parties including Sen. The economist said that the entire land occupied by him on the campus was registered on a long term lease that was nowhere close to expiry.  “I protest the dictatorial and autocratic conduct of Visva-Bharati with a personality like Amartya Sen. We are here to register our protest and opposition to the treatment meted out to Sen and express our solidarity with him, Goswami said.  The vice-chancellor of Visva-Bharati was appointed by the BJP-led government at the Centre which is targeting Sen as he had never been afraid to air his views, Suman alleged. Basu said, “The BJP has always been opposed to free thinkers. We have assembled here to voice our protest. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already pledged her solidarity to Amartya Sen.” Banerjee, also the Trinamool Congress supremo, had claimed that the world renowned economist has been subjected to such attack by the present authorities of the university because of his ideological anti-BJP stance.  The US-based economist, an icon of Bengali achievement on world stage, has often been critical of the Narendra Modi government’’s economic policies. Reacting to the protests, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “Those intellectuals should keep in mind that the Trinamool Congress is fast losing the support of people of the state. They must remember that the TMC uses intellectuals only when it faces imminent defeat.” At an event held on a different issue, senior CPI(M) leader and Left Front chairman Biman Bose said that the way Sen is being treated by Visva-Bharati authorities is most unfortunate.  He said that the West Bengal government should hold discussions with the university authorities so that they stop treating the economist in this way.  Sen was born in 1933 at Santiniketan, which is home to Visva-Bharati, the university founded by Rabindranath Tagore, another Nobel prize recipient and a Bengali icon.  Visva-Bharati authorities had never complained to him or his family about any irregularity in holding the land, the economist said in a statement on the land controversy on Friday. ",thehindu

JD(U) not in favour of laws against conversion for marriage: KC Tyagi
"," At a time when BJP ruled states are making legislation against conversion for marriage, the Janata Dal (United), an ally of the saffron party in Bihar, on Sunday asserted that such laws will create social hatred and division in the society which it does not approve of.  “An atmosphere of hatred and division is being created in the society in the name of Love Jihad,” Mr. Tyagi told reporters after the party’s national executive meeting here. The term “love jihad” is used by right-wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. “Provisions of the Constitution and CrPC give freedom to two adults to choose life partners of their choice irrespective of one’s religion, caste or region,” Mr. Tyagi said. Socialists have upheld the right of adults to marry irrespective of caste and creed since the days of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, he said. Lohia was a socialist ideologue. The Cabinet in BJP governed Madhya Pradesh on Saturday passed a Bill which provides for prison term of up to 10 years and fine of ₹1 lakh for conversion through marriage or by any other fraudulent means. The bill in some ways is similar to an Ordinance notified by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh last month. In Uttar Pradesh, a PIL has been filed in the Allahabad High Court challenging the ordinance, contending that it impinges upon the fundamental right to choice and right to change of faith. ",thehindu

Andy Murray receives Australian Open wild-card entry "," Five-time Australian Open finalist Andy Murray has been given a wild-card entry into the first Grand Slam tournament of next year. Former top-ranked Murray has slipped to No. 122 in the ATP rankings after several years of battling hip injuries and surgery. “We welcome Andy back to Melbourne with open arms,” Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said Monday. “As a five-time finalist he has been an integral part of so many amazing matches and storylines in the recent history of the Australian Open.” Murray made a teary retirement announcement in Melbourne two years ago before undergoing a second round of surgeries to extend his career. “His retirement was an emotional moment and seeing him come back, having undergone major surgery and build himself back up to get onto the tour again, will be a highlight of AO 2021,” Tiley added. The rescheduled Australian Open will be played from Feb. 8-21, three weeks later than the original date in order to allow players and officials to spend 14 days in quarantine once they arrive in Australia. The players will be allowed five hours of practice each day at Melbourne Park, but must stay confined to their hotel rooms otherwise. Also receiving a wild card was Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis, who is also recovering from a series of injuries and hasn’t played a tour match since the 2019 U.S. Open. He missed the 2020 Australian Open due to glandular fever. Fellow Australians Destanee Aiava and Arina Rodionova gained wild cards into the 128-women’s draw. India’s Sumit Nagal and China’s Wang Xiyu were awarded wild cards from the Asia-Pacific for the men’s and women’s main draw, respectively.",thehindu

U.S. government heads toward chaotic end to 2020 as Trump fights Congress
"," The U.S. government headed toward a chaotic last few days of the year as President Donald Trump’s refusal to approve a $2.3 trillion financial package caused millions of jobless Americans to lose benefits and threatened to shut down federal agencies due to lack of funding. Mr. Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20 after losing November’s election, came under pressure on Sunday from lawmakers on both sides to stop blocking the pandemic aid and government funding bill which was approved by Congress last week. The Republican president has demanded that Congress change the bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to $2,000 from $600. Many economists agree that the financial aid in the bill should be higher to get the economy moving again but say that immediate support for Americans hit by coronavirus lockdowns is still urgently needed. Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million people through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but could be restarted until mid-March if Mr. Trump signs the bill. Adding to the uncertainty, the package includes $1.4trillion in spending to fund government agencies. If Trump does not sign the legislation, then a partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday that would put millions of government workers’ incomes at risk, unless Congress steps in with as top-gap measure the president accepts. Republican Senator Pat Toomey told “Fox News Sunday” that Mr. Trump should approve the bill now, then push for more unemployment money later. “I understand the president would like to send bigger checks to everybody. I think what he ought to do is sign this bill and then make the case. Congress can pass another bill,” Toomey said. “You don’t get everything you want, even if you are the president of the United States,” he said. After months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he later said he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892billion in coronavirus financial relief, despite offering no objections to the terms of the deal before Congress voted it through on Monday. Trump spent the Christmas holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. On Sunday morning, he seemed in no rush to try to resolve the stand-off with Congress as he headed for the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. He has also complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid. “What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel,” Senator Bernie Sanders said of the delay. “We are dealing with an unprecedented moment in American history. So many people are hurting,” he told ABC News’ “This Week” show. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, urged Trump to “finally do the right thing for theAmerican people and stop worrying about his ego.”  Americans are living through a bitter holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000people, the highest since the pandemic began. The relief package also extends a moratorium on evictions that expires on Dec. 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution. Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois,said Trump’s refusal to sign the economic stimulus bill was difficult to fathom. “I don’t get the point,” Kinzinger told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Unless it’s just to create chaos, and show power, and be upset because you lost the election.” The U.S. Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, is preparing to return to work. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives plans to vote on Monday on legislation providing one-time $2,000 checks to people, but Republican lawmakers are already concerned about the cost of the larger package. Without enactment of the broad relief and funding bill, the U.S. government runs out of money at midnight Dec. 28. If the battle with Trump is not resolved by then, Congress must either pass a stopgap funding bill or federal agencies will not have money to fully operate beginning Tuesday. That scenario could be avoided if both the House and Senate pass a funding bill that is separate from the pandemic legislation and the president signs it by midnight Monday.",thehindu

U.S. taking hard look at variant of coronavirus: Fauci
","  U.S. health officials believe the coronavirus mutation that set off alarms in parts of Britain is no more apt to cause serious illness or be resistant to vaccines than the strain afflicting people in the United States but it still must be taken “very seriously”, the government’s top infectious disease expert said. Dr. Anthony Fauci endorsed the decision of U.S. officials to require negative COVID-19 tests before letting people from Britain enter the U.S.  He declined to weigh in on whether that step should have been taken sooner.  He said the variant strain is something “to follow very carefully” and “we’re looking at it very intensively now”.  “Does it make someone more ill? Is it more serious virus in the sense of virulence? And the answer is, it doesn’t appear to be that way,” Dr. Fauci said.  British officials are telling their US colleagues it appears that the vaccines being rolled out will be strong enough to deal with the new variant but, Dr. Fauci said, “we’re going to be doing the studies ourselves”. Dr. Fauci said the U.S. is at a critical phase of the pandemic, with the worst probably still ahead. He predicted the general population would be getting immunised widely by late March or early April — beyond the frontline workers, older people and certain other segments of the public given priority for the vaccines.",thehindu

Turkish lawmakers pass bill monitoring civil society groups
"," Turkey’s parliament approved a law Sunday that would increase government monitoring of civil society groups, which rights groups have warned would violate the freedom of association.  Newly introduced articles on associations and foundations, included in the bill on “Preventing Financing of Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,” allow the annual inspection of non-governmental organizations, ostensibly to combat terrorism financing.  The law also lets the interior ministry replace members of associations if they are being investigated on terrorism charges and gives it the power to suspend activities with a court order. It also allows courts to block access to online donation campaigns without permits.  The bill, proposed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, passed with the votes of the party and its nationalist allies.  Turkey’s anti-terrorism laws are broad and have led to the jailing of politicians, journalists, civil society activists and thousands of others.  Nearly 680 civil society groups signed a declaration against the bill, saying it would limit their ability to raise funds and organize while putting them under ministry pressure. They said the law violates the Turkish Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of association.  “Turkish prosecutors regularly open terrorism investigations into people for peacefully exercising rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement before the vote.  The rights group warned the law would “widen the scope for the Interior Ministry to restrict the activities of any organization and individuals engaged in them.” The law would also apply to international civil society groups operating in Turkey.

Top associate of Russia’s Navalny released from detention
","  A top associate of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was released from detention Sunday and said she was charged with trespassing after entering the apartment building of an alleged security operative who inadvertently revealed details of Navalny’s supposed poisoning with a Soviet-era nerve agent.  Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours on Friday after a day of interrogation.  The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into revealing details of his alleged poisoning.  Sobol and her allies denied the accusations and maintained that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of violent trespassing — criminal charges that carry a sentence of up to two years in prison.  Shortly after her release from detention Sunday, Sobol told reporters she has been formally charged and insisted the case against her was “revenge” on Navalny.  On Monday, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he identified as Konstantin Kudryavtsev and described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him with the Soviet-era Novichok agent in August and then tried to cover it up.  Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned.  In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.  Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake. ",thehindu

Videos of the protests posted by independent news outlets showed protesters with with red and white flags marching through courtyards in residential areas of Minsk and chanting “Long live Belarus!” and “As long as we're united, we're invincible.” The Viasna human rights center released names of 10 people that have been detained in Minsk and three more in other Belarusian cities.  Mass protests have gripped Belarus, an ex-Soviet nation of 9.5 million people, ever since official results from the Aug. 9 presidential election gave Lukashenko a landslide victory over his widely popular opponent, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. She and her supporters refused to recognize the result, saying the vote was riddled with fraud.  Authorities have cracked down hard on the largely peaceful demonstrations, the biggest of which attracted up to 200,000 people. Police have used stun grenades, tear gas and truncheons to disperse the rallies, and thousands of people have been detained and brutally beaten. Nevertheless, the protests have continued for almost five months.  The opposition's Coordination Council, formed shortly after the election to push for a transition of power, issued a statement on Sunday thanking Belarusians for taking to the streets again during the last weekend of 2020. “The Coordination Council is grateful to brave Belarusians that don't stop despite intimidation and trumped-up accusations in order to draw nearer a life in Belarus that we dream of and deserve,” the statement read. “We know that Belarusians are going into the new year with a common dream and (we) are convinced that we can't be stopped along the way.”",thehindu

British tourists sneak out of Swiss ski resort
","  Hundreds of British tourists forced into quarantine in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier fled in the night rather than seeing their holidays go downhill, the local municipality said Sunday. Around 200 of the 420 or so affected British tourists in the luxury Alpine ski station quit under the cover of darkness, the SonntagsZeitung newspaper reported. Switzerland’s ski resorts were set to boom with snow-seeking British tourists — but a flight ban due to the new COVID-19 variant raging in England put those plans on ice. The drastic ruling by the Swiss government also included a 10-day retroactive quarantine for anyone who arrived from Britain since December 14, following the discovery of a new variant of the coronavirus which experts fear spreads more quickly. Some of the British tourists affected in Verbier left immediately, while others stuck it out for a bit before quitting. “Many of them stayed in quarantine for a day before they set off unnoticed under the cover of darkness,” Jean-Marc Sandoz, spokesman for the wider Bagnes municipality, told SZ. He called the whole situation “the worst week our community has ever experienced”. British tourists normally make up 21% of the Verbier clientele, and most start pouring in just after Christmas. Voted Switzerland’s best ski resort for the past two years, Verbier markets itself as offering “adrenaline-packed thrills, simple pleasures and a chic lifestyle”.  The Verbier Tourist Office has been holding daily crisis cell meetings to try to deal with the ever-changing coronavirus picture. “It was when they saw the meal trays remained untouched that the hoteliers noticed that the customers had gone,” Sandoz told ATS news agency. He said that according to a Saturday survey of the ski resort’s hotels, fewer than 10 people would still be in quarantine. The rest would either have left or their quarantine time would have expired. “We can’t blame them. In most cases, quarantine was untenable. Imagine four people staying in a hotel room of 20 square metres,” Sandoz said. He said the tourists left feeling “a little angry with Switzerland” and with the sense of having been “trapped”. Flights between Switzerland and the two countries were halted on Monday, but the first outbound flights from Zurich to Britain resumed on Thursday. Two cases of the new British coronavirus variant have been detected in Switzerland and one in neighbouring Liechtenstein, the Swiss health ministry said Sunday. Two cases of the new South African variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, have also been detected, the ministry said.",thehindu

Egypt delegation visits Libyan capital, meets Tripoli government
"," Egyptian diplomats and intelligence officials arrived in the Libyan capital of Tripoli on Sunday, Libyan officials said, the most senior Egyptian delegation to visit the western part of the conflict-stricken country in years. The Egyptian delegation was headed by Ayman Badea, the deputy chief of the General Intelligence Service, Egypt’s version of the CIA. The delegation met with Fathi Bashagha, the powerful interior minister of the Tripoli-based government, as well as Emad Trapolsi, head of intelligence in western Libya. Bashagha’s office said in a statement that they discussed “mutual security challenges and ways to enhance security cooperation.” They also discussed ways to support a U.N.-brokered cease-fire deal that Libya’s warring sides reached in October, the statement said. Oil-rich Libya is currently split between the U.N.-supported government in Tripoli and a rival administration based in the city of Benghazi and which controls the country’s east and south. The country was plunged into chaos after the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Egypt views the instability in neighbouring Libya as a national security threat. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates back the eastern forces, led by military commander Khalifa Hifter. The Tripoli government primarily has backing from Turkey, whose military support helped cause the collapse this spring of Hifter’s year-long attempt to capture Tripoli. The Egyptian delegation also met with Ahmed Matiq, the deputy prime minister of the Tripoli government. Matiq said they discussed the reopening of the Egyptian Embassy in Tripoli after an over six-year closure, as well as the resumption of flights between the two countries. There was no official comment from Egypt about the visit, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment.  The visit to western Libya came just over a week after Egypt’s intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, met in Benghazi with Hifter and the speaker of the eastern-based parliament, Aguila Saleh. Bashagha, the Tripoli-based interior minister, seeks to lead an interim government that would rule Libya until an election set for next December. He visited Cairo in November, part of efforts by the two countries to “fight the threat of terrorism and organized crime,” his office said at the time. The Egyptian delegation’s visit also came one day after Turkey’s Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, along with the military’s chief of staff Yasar Guler and other commanders, met with officials in Tripoli. In comments run by Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency on Sunday, Akar threatened to target Hifter’s forces if there were any attacks against Turkish forces in Libya. He called Hifter and his supporters the “main problem” in Libya, an apparent reference to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Akar’s comments seemed to be in response to Hifter, who last week said he would target Turkish troops in Libya if Ankara doesn’t stop interfering in the country. He said Turkey could “leave peacefully or to be driven out by force.” Last week, Turkey’s parliament also extended for 18 months a law that allows the deployment of troops to Libya.",thehindu

In addition, a man who confronted the villagers over their belief was also lynched. Police said that they have already arrested nine persons but six other accused involved in the incident on Wednesday night are still at large. Asserting that efforts are on to nab six others too, police said that incident took place in Rohimapur area under the Dokmoka police station of Karbi Anglong district. Villagers said that on Wednesday, at a post-death ritual for a deceased in the village, another woman -- a 50-year-old widow Ramawati Halua -- started to behave in an abnormal way to which the villagers alleged that she was practicing witchcraft. Pointing out that most of the villagers also held the woman responsible for recent deaths and spread of diseases, police said that a mob started beating her and attacked her with sharp weapons. When a 28-year-old educated young man of the village, Bijoy Gaur, accused them of being superstitious, he was attacked too. The angry mob lynched both of them to death, offered rituals to the local deity and tried to cremate the bodies in a nearby hill. Karbi Anglong’s Superintendent of Police Debojit Deori said that they came to know about the incident on Thursday morning as it happened on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. “We went to the spot and collected mortal remains of the victims. We have also seized the sharp weapons used for the crime and have arrested nine people so far,” he said. It was under the Dokmoka police station jurisdiction that two young men were beaten to death by an angry mob in 2018 after it suspected them of being child-lifters. It is significant that there have been many attempts to check incident of witch hunting, a social evil that has plagued parts of the state for decades. In 2001, Assam police had introduced Project Prahari, a community project by the police against killing of women after branding them as witches. According to official records, till December 2019, a total of 107 persons have been killed in witch-hunting incidents in the state since 2011. The Assam Witch Hunting (Prohibition, Prevention and Protection) Act, which implements stringent punishment and fine for branding and killing people after branding them as “witches”, is in effect in the state since 2018. According to the law, witch-hunting is viewed as a cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. It was passed by Assam Assembly in 2015 with provisions of jail term up to life imprisonment.",theasianage

In a statement, Trump's physician Dr. Sean Conley said he received confirmation of the positive tests on Thursday evening. ""The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence,"" Conley said. ""The White House medical team and I will maintain a vigilant watch, and I appreciate the support provided by some of our country's greatest medical professionals and institutions,"" Conley said. Rest assured I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering, and I will keep you updated on any future developments, the physician added.

Clearly defending them, he also demanded their release and blamed the NIA and the Narendra Modi government of defaming the Muslim community in the name of terrorism.

At Berhampore district library office in Murshidabad, he claimed, ""As far as my knowledge goes, all those who were arrested on the allegations of being terrorists of Al-Qaeda from Domkal and other places are totally innocent. Some of them had only read religious preacher Zakir Naik's books and pamphlets which is not a sin at all."" The family members of the ten accused were present with Chowdhury at the press meet.

Having played their first two games at Sharjah, the smallest of the three venues, Royals got their strategy wrong in the game against Kolkata Knight Riders in Dubai. The ground here too is on the bigger side and Royals' experience of playing in Dubai will help them take more informed decisions. RCB will also be making their first appearance at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium. With the batsmen unable to hit through the line as consistently as they could do in Sharjah, Royals failed to chase 175 against KKR on Wednesday. Since they have a settled overseas players' combination, one possible change in the eleven could be replacing pacer Ankit Rajpoot with Varun Aaron, who is yet to get a game. The team has benched young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal after Jos Buttler's arrival but calls have been growing for his inclusion. With the top three picking themselves, the stylish southpaw can only play in the middle order. Both Royals and the RCB go into Saturday's afternoon match with two wins in three games. RCB have made a promising start but need to improve their fielding and death bowling. Navdeep Saini bowled a tidy Super Over against Mumbai Indians to get his team over the line after RCB leaked as many as 79 runs in the last four overs for the game to be tied. The Bangalore franchise made three changes in the previous clash and are likely to give those players - Isuru Udana, Adam Zampa and Gurkeerat Mann - another go. The move to open the bowling with Washington Sundar paid off as the offie returned with figures of 12 for one in four overs in a game where more than 400 runs were scored. Ab de Villiers has shown ominous touch and it must be heartening for the team management to see Shivam Dube providing the big hits towards the end against Mumbai Indians.

The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court also took note, summoning the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary, director general of police and additional director general of police on October 12 in connection with the case. Justices Rajan Roy and Jaspreet Singh have also called the victim's parents to have their say in court that day. Taking suo moto cognisance of the case, which has triggered widespread outrage, the bench also ordered Hathras district magistrate and superintendent of police to appear with to apprise the court of various aspects of the case, including the ongoing probe into it. ""The incidents which took place after the death of the victim on September 29, 2020 leading up to her cremation, as alleged, have shocked our conscience. Therefore, we are taking suo moto cognizance of the same,"" the bench said in its order. The woman succumbed to the severe injuries she suffered when she was allegedly assaulted by four upper-caste men  later arrested -- in the fields at her village in Hathras district on September 14. She was cremated in Hathras in the dead of the night with family members saying they were not allowed to bring the body home one last time. But police claimed they had the family's consent for the cremation. Rahul, Priyanka arrested Meanwhile, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were detained by UP police in Greater Noida, just outside Delhi, when they insisted on marching to Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old woman. The two leaders and about 150 party workers were held briefly and booked for violating prohibitory orders. They were let off after they furnished personal bonds. The melee on the Yamuna Expressway was the biggest among scattered protests during the day over the death of the woman, who the UP police controversially suggested was not a victim of rape. Party workers first gathered on the road on the Delhi-Noida border, dispersing only after the convoy of cars carrying Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra passed them. The cars were stopped a few minutes later on the Yamuna Expressway by UP police. The Gandhis then insisted they will proceed on foot to Hathras, about 150 km away. Police tried to stop them again, citing prohibitory orders which prevent assembly of people. At one point, a video clip showed, Gandhi taking a fall amid the melee. He was quickly helped on his feet by his security personnel. Another clip showed him challenging a police offer. ""Can you tell me under which law you can stop me from marching towards Hathras?"" he said. ""I want to go alone to Hathras and on what basis can you arrest me?"" he said, arguing that this would not lead to any violation of section 144 of the CrPC. The leaders were later taken away in police cars, reportedly to the guesthouse at the International Buddh Circuit, before being released. Opposition outraged Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati demanded that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should be replaced or President's rule imposed in the state. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray also targeted the Uttar Pradesh government. ""Have no words to condemn the barbaric & shameful incident at Hathras involving a young Dalit girl. My deepest condolences to the family. More shameful is the forceful cremation without the family’s presence or consent, exposing those who use slogans & lofty promises for votes,"" Mamata tweeted. Thackeray, while addressing a virtual meeting, said that Hathras-like incidents won't be tolerated in Maharashtra and perpetrators of such crimes will be be severely punished. In Haryana, Dalit organisations and other outfits held protests in Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Fatehabad and Rohtak. Congress workers blocked an arterial road in Kolkata and held a candlelight protest in Hyderabad. BJP vs Congress spat As the events unfolded, Congress alleged that Gandhi was roughed up and other protesters faced lathis. ""Lala Lajpat Rai had said that every blow of a stick on my body would prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the British Raj. ""The sticks on Rahul ji and Priyanka ji's convoy will also prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the Yogi government,"" party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi. UP minister Siddharth Nath Singh was dismissive of the ""photo op"", questioning even the fall suffered by Gandhi. The BJP also accused the Congress leaders of ignoring atrocities in the states ruled by that party. Uttar Pradesh Congress gave a call for a statewide protest on Friday against the detention of Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. All district and city unit presidents were asked to hold immediate dharnas against the behaviour of the UP police which had detained the leaders.",theasianage

The WHO report said the Odisha government effectively managed the COVID-19 pandemic situation. The Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) on its official Twitter handle posted the WHO article which read, “From Governance to Community Resilience: Odisha’s Response to COVID-19” which appeared in the WHO portal. The CMO made this article public on the day when the Opposition BJP and Congress came down heavily on the state government in the Assembly and accused it of failing to manage the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Both the parties alleged that the patients were dying due to improper and inadequate attention paid by the COVID-19 hospitals. They even said COVID-19 hospitals were fleecing money from the patients in different pretexts under the very nose of the health department officials. State health minister Nabakishore Das, however, refuted all the charges of the Opposition and said the state had earned accolades from WHO and many other agencies for its efficient Covid management. The CMO in a sticker attached to the Twitter post highlighted WHO’s points for which the state has earned praise. “They are early containment measures, dedicated Covid Hospitals, effective monitoring, telemedicine and plasma therapy, realtime information through state COVID dashboard, training of 1,80,000 health workers and financial incentives,” it said. The CMO also said that effective governance, robust health infrastructure, testing strategy, technology-aided pandemic management, migrant management, decentralised management through gram panchayats and involvement of Mission Shakti helped ineffective management of COVID-19. As of June 24, 2020, the state recorded an impressive recovery rate of 69.4 per cent, and the mortality rate of just 0.29 per cent, which is one of the best in the country. Odisha was the first in the country to initiate strict measures, the CMO mentioned. “The chief minister ordered an immediate closure of many public places on March 13, even though the state had not reported a single case of COVID-19,” the article dated September 17 said. It said that when the first case was reported on March 15, the state control rooms had been made operational, and capacity building of the district level health officials on preparedness and response activities, and public awareness campaigns on hand-washing and respiratory etiquettes were already initiated.",theasianage

He also assured that no one can claim ownership of farmers' land in lieu of contract farming and said there are enough measures in the legislations to safeguard the interests of farmers. Opposition parties have alleged that farmers would be left at the mercy of corporates under the new laws, which have come into effect after the passage of three key bills in the recent monsoon session of Parliament. Hitting out at Congress and other opposition parties, Singh said they are trying to create misunderstandings about the farm bills passed by Parliament. He also attacked Congress for the burning of a tractor by protesters from their youth wing. ""A tractor was burnt. What is its logic? As weapons are sacred and respectable for soldiers, similarly tractors are to farmers. And I know this being a farmer, in any eventuality farmer will never burn his tractor. This was done by a political party for its political interest,"" he said. The Congress' youth wing activists on Monday had set a tractor ablaze near India Gate in the national capital, a few hundred metres from the Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament, to protest the contentious farm laws. Talking to a select group of journalists, the Defence Minister said, ""Being a farmer's son myself, I want to make it clear that the Modi government will never do anything that is not in the interest of farmers. And these agriculture-related bills are for economic and social empowerment of farmers."" Singh also accused the Opposition of creating a misunderstanding among people about the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism and the mandi system and categorically said that both will stay. ""I want to assure farmers that the MSP will stay and rather it will be continuously increased in the coming years, in any case, it will not be abolished,"" he said adding that MSP in oilseeds and pulses increased by 23 times during the BJP-led NDA government. On amendment in the APMC Act, Rajnath said the government is not ending the mandi system and rather it is giving more options to farmers to sell their produce including at more mandis. He also said that at times farmers were charged taxes and did not get the right MSP in mandis, but the new law will provide them more options to sell their produce. Talking about contract farming, Singh said enough provisions have been made in the new law to safeguard the interests of farmers. Farmers will get the price of their produce as decided by them in the contract,  and sufficient provisions have been incorporated to ensure that the price does not go below the contracted rate, he said. Singh further said if prices of their produce rise at a later stage, farmers will also get proportionately higher payments. Accusing the Opposition of creating misapprehensions about the new law that it poses a threat to farmers' land, Singh said, ""No power, in any case, can claim ownership of farmers' land using this bill. Enough measures have been made to safeguard the interests of farmers."" Underlining that all agriculture-related legislations are meant for the social and economic empowerment of farmers, Singh appealed to farmers and their organisation to come and talk to him to clear any misgivings. ""I appeal to all farmers' organisations that if they have any issue please come and talk with us. We are ready to listen to their suggestions for the welfare of farmers. I have already started talking to farmers organisations to clear misgivings and misconceptions,"" he said. The government has been under attack from the Opposition for the passage of three farms bill in the recently held monsoon session of Parliament. The government presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of 'mandis'. It has also said that farmers will be now free to sell their produce to anyone and these legislations will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment. However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as ""anti-farmers"", claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests. President Ram Nath Kovind has already given assent to the three farm bills -- The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.",theasianage

The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index or PMI compiled by IHS Markit, jumped to 56.8 in September from 52.0 in August, above the 50-level separating growth from contraction for a second straight month.

They said that the Pakistani troops resorted to an “unprovoked violation” of the November 2003 ceasefire understanding along the LoC’s Nougam sector in Kupwara on Thursday. “Pakistan initiated an unprovoked ceasefire violation along LoC in Nougam sector, Kupwara today morning by firing mortars and other weapons, resulting in fatal injuries to two of our soldiers whereas the four others wounded were immediately evacuated to a military hospital,” defence spokesperson Colonel Rajesh Kalia said. He added that the Indian troops were giving “befitting response” to the Pakistani firing and shelling.

25,0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/congress-certify-election-biden-republicans-object,US politics  Congress certifies Joe Biden as president hours after storming of Capitol ,"The US Congress has certified Joe Biden as the next president of the United States hours after an insurgent mob loyal to Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in what lawmakers condemned as an attempted insurrection aimed at overturning the results of an American election. Shaken by the extraordinary scenes of chaos and violence that struck at the heart of American democracy – and were condemned by US allies worldwide - members of the House and Senate returned to the Capitol to continue the process of validating Biden’s victory, closing the session shortly before 4am local time. A statement from Trump following the certification said there would be an “orderly transition” to a Biden administration “even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out.” It was posted on Twitter by aides since the outgoing president’s social media accounts are locked to prevent the spread of misinformation and incitement to violence. Several Republican senators, unsettled by the day’s events, which had seen them duck under tables and don gas masks, said they no longer supported a brazen but doomed effort to keep Trump in office by rejecting the results of the electoral college as the certification proceeded. In late night speeches, lawmakers lamented the siege of the hallowed halls of Congress and the deep divisions – sharpened and exploited by the president – that led to this perilous moment. “This failed attempt to obstruct the Congress, this failed insurrection, only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our republic,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said, declaring that lawmakers would not be intimidated by “thugs, mobs, or threats”. Speaking to both the would-be revolutionaries who stormed and occupied the Capitol and the rebels in his own caucus who supported an effort to throw out the election results, McConnell vowed to “certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election”. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer – who in the midst of the mayhem learned that he would soon become the majority leader after Democrats won a second runoff election in Georgia – said 6 January was a day that would “live for ever in infamy”. The uprising disrupted what was the early stages of a futile attempt by dozens of congressional Republicans to reject certification of the electoral college votes, that affirmed Trump’s defeat, 306-232. Traditionally a ceremonial affair, Trump convinced his allies on Capitol Hill to turn the pro forma ritual into what would be his last stand in an increasingly reckless effort to cling to power. The constitutionally-mandated joint session of Congress began at 1pm, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, presiding over the proceedings and each states’ electoral votes secured in mahogany boxes. But the proceedings quickly devolved into a shocking series of events unprecedented in modern American history, as hundreds and then thousands of Trump supporters, many wearing red Maga caps and some armed, barrelled past security barricades and bashed through the Capitol doors. Some smashed windows and scaled the building’s exterior, waving Trump flags from a balcony, while authorities, seemingly outnumbered and unprepared, struggled to regain control. By nightfall, authorities said the Capitol had been secured. Escorted by armed officers, Pence, who was presiding over the joint session of Congress, senators and members of the House returned to their chambers to resume debate over an objection to the electoral college count. But the mood had changed remarkably from earlier that afternoon, when a band of Republicans arrived on Capitol Hill prepared to lead a futile rebellion against certification. Several senators reversed course and voted to uphold the results of the electoral college after saying they would object. Others were undeterred. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, one of the Senate leaders seeking to overturn the results, argued that the earlier violence should not dismiss his concerns that fraud had occurred during the election. Just after midnight, he joined some House Republicans in seeking to throw out Pennsylvania’s electoral slate. For those who planned to forge ahead with the plot, Republicans senator Mitt Romney warned in a floor speech that drew sustained applause that they would “forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy”. Congress voted down challenges to reject Biden’s wins in Arizona and Pennsylvania, based on spurious claims of widespread voter fraud. The House rejected the challenge to the Arizona result by a vote of 303-122 and the Senate voted it down 93-6. The Pennsylvania challenge was voted down 282-138 in the House and 92-7 in the Senate. A majority of House Republicans voted to overturn the Pennsylvania result, despite no evidence of significant voter fraud in the state and multiple failed court challenges in past weeks. Attempts by House Republicans to object to the electoral slate in Georgia, Michigan Nevada and Wisconsin failed to garner support from a senator and were not considered. Earlier in the day, rioters for hours roamed the marbled halls of Congress shouting: “We want Trump.” Amid the bedlam, one woman was fatally shot, the DC police confirmed. The building was placed on lockdown, and the DC mayor imposed a rare 6pm curfew, as national guard troops were activated. After initially declaring “this is a time for strength” and urging his supporters to “walk down to the Capitol”, Trump later attempted to appeal for calm. In a video taped from the White House, the president instructed his followers to “go home”. But he also fueled their grievances by again claiming the election was “stolen.” Facebook and Twitter removed the video. In remarks from Wilmington, Biden condemned what he called an “unprecedented assault and implored Trump to “fulfil his oath” and “demand an end to this siege”. “This is not dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition,” said Biden, who is just two weeks away from being sworn in as the 46th US president. “The world is watching.” Several lawmakers said the day’s events were tantamount to an attempted coup. Teargas was deployed in the Capitol Rotunda. Rioters, who were mostly white men, streamed into the Senate chamber. One swung from the balcony above the floor. They trashed the office of the Senate parliamentarian and entered the private office of the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, leaving behind a note that read: “WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.” In a shocking episode, officers drew their guns on the floor of the House, where just outside an armed protester faced off with Capitol police. Many blamed the president for stoking the violence by refusing to accept the reality of his decisive electoral defeat. Romney, who lost the 2012 presidential election to Barack Obama, described what transpired on Wednesday as the result of a “selfish man’s injured pride”. All 50 states have certified the election results after a number of closely contested states conducted post-election audits and recounts to ensure their accuracy. Courts at every level, including the supreme court, have rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies to challenge the results. Wednesday was to be his day of reckoning. In his increasingly desperate bid to remain in power, Trump, who has yet to concede, spent the last several weeks attempting to enlist allies and pressure public officials to overturn Biden’s win. His machinations escalated last weekend when he demanded the Georgia secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, “find” enough votes to reverse his defeat in the state. His ire then turned to Pence, who he implored publicly to do “the right thing” and reject the electoral vote tally – a power the vice-president does not have. Pence’s decision not to interfere in the certification process infuriated Trump, who lashed out at him on Wednesday as he was being escorted from the Senate chamber out of concern for his safety. “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!” Trump said in a tweet flagged by Twitter for amplifying falsehoods about the election. Twitter later suspended the president’s account. Several House Democrats called for Trump’s removal from office, blaming Trump for fomenting the violence that unfolded. With two weeks left in his presidency, congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, said she was drawing up articles of impeachment and congressman Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, urged Pence to invoke the 25th amendment and remove him from office. “Let me be very clear: if all we do is accept the certified electoral college results and go home, we would have failed our country,” Lieu said in a tweet calling for Trump’s removal office. “Congress cannot just go home like nothing happened.”",theguardian
26,2,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-capitol-american-carnage-washington,American carnage  How Trump's footsoldiers ran riot in the Capitol ,"A rioter leaned back in the chair of the speaker of the House Representatives and brought a brown boot down on the papers left strewn on her desk. Elsewhere in the Capitol building, a lectern bearing the gold seal of Congress was ripped away and framed documents were torn from the walls, as Trump banners and Confederate flags were paraded through abandoned hallways. It was Wednesday afternoon, 6 January, when Donald Trump’s four-year assault on US democracy reached its inescapable destination, an orgy of violence aimed at the heart of the republic. Staffers in some offices barricaded their doors and hid under their desks like one of the active shooter lockdowns the country’s school children practised when they still went to school. “Where the fuck are the Capitol police?” a staffer texted to a journalist friend. The police were overwhelmed, and the mass ranks of national guard and federal agents who had crushed peaceful Black Lives Matter protests in the summer were nowhere to be seen until evening fell. In the corridors outside, Trumpist rioters were able to roam freely, as they looked for members of Congress they saw as enemies. They found their way into the Senate chamber where minutes earlier the election results were being certified. A rioter stepped on to the dais and, according to a reporter on the scene, yelled: “Trump won that election.” Police fired teargas as the rioters pushed inside the gleaming white edifice of the Capitol. One woman was shot by the US Capitol police and later died of her injuries, according to the Washington police. Three others died in “medical emergencies” throughout the day, authorities said. . Rioters attacked TV crews outside the building. Several police officers were also injured. Authorities found pipe bombs outside the offices of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, as well as a cooler with a long gun and Molotov cocktail on the Capitol grounds. When the defeated president was first sworn into office almost four years ago, he raised the spectre of “American carnage”. He portrayed it as something that had gone before, but it very soon became clear it was what was still to come. As Trump has made clear for months, he has been prepared to wreak carnage on the political system that elevated him to the most powerful office, if it ever threatened to spit him out. The party who enabled his rise and then grew terrified of him has been left broken, so divided that the Republicans lost both Senate seats in the southern bastion of Georgia, results confirmed on Wednesday. At the moment the Trumpist footsoldiers stormed the Capitol, the Republicans had split into duelling factions. A dozen senators and over a hundred representatives were prepared to follow him across the Rubicon and vote against certifying the confirmed results of November’s presidential election. The vice president Mike Pence, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell and most Republican senators wanted to jump off the Trump train before it reached its last stop, and tried to put an end to the president’s fevered delusion that the presidency would be handed back to him after electoral defeat. It was the declaration from Pence – who had hitherto been assiduously loyal to the leader – that he would follow the constitution and read out the election result, rather than try to change it, that apparently triggered Trump’s wrath, and set in motion the events that led to the storming of the Capitol. As senators were being hustled to safety, a leading member of the latter faction, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, is reported to have told a leader of the loyalists, Ted Cruz, “This is what you’ve gotten” – a clumsy, desperate epitaph for the party the Republicans thought they were. The orange genie, who had been out of the bottle for four years granting the Republicans every wish, was not going back in without tearing down the palace walls, turning the party’s own supporters against it. Less than an hour before the Capitol was breached, Trump had told his supporters: “We want to be so respectful of everybody – bad people. And we are going to have to fight much harder.” He told them to march from the White House along the national mall to the Capitol to “save our democracy”. He even said he would go with them, but it was just another promise he had no intention of keeping, taking his motorcade instead the hundred yards back to the White House. Go to the Congress “peacefully and patriotically” he told them, but a matter of minutes later, the barricades outside the Capitol were down and the mob was charging. They had been told, again and again, their nation was at stake, child-trafficking Chinese-run socialists were taking over, and they had to fight harder. Those Republicans who failed to overturn the election were “weak” and “pathetic”, allowing Democrats to destroy the country. Trump singled out his formerly loyal deputy. “Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn’t, that will be a sad day for our country,” Trump yelled from a stage that had been set up a block from the White House, for a crowd that had gathered on the grassy Ellipse below the national monument. As the president was speaking, Pence had however jumped ship. For the first time, with two weeks of the presidency to run, he did the opposite of what he was being told by his boss. Hours after his supporters had stormed the Capitol, Trump released a video telling them: “Go home, we love you, you’re very special”. But he also used the video to repeat his baseless claims about the “fraudulent” vote which he lost. As night fell over the capital he tweeted: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!” The seeds of violence were disguised inside the husk of the old order. Wednesday itself had appeared to begin like any other American political carnival, with bright flags, exuberant costumes and vendors selling T-shirts and hot-dogs. It was only with a closer look, that something far more dystopian was at hand, with a seething potential for violence. “Fuck Your Feelings, Trump 2020,” was the message on the fastest-selling T-shirt. Some of the flags declared: “Fuck Biden”. The crowd that sprawled across the Ellipse was a mix of families and the elderly, men and women, young and old. Only about one in ten was wearing camouflage gear, though that was more than the percentage wearing masks. A young couple, Kasey and Mike, were sitting under one of the ornamental cherry trees near the monument, having traveled down from Rhode Island. They spoke with with the dreamy smiles of two people in love, sharing a moment in history, but their message was one of looming conflict. “People here are mad. They’ve watched so many people destroy our country like that. I don’t think they’re just gonna sit back any more,” Kasey said. “I think Trump’s only option he really has left is to call military action into it because he has the right to do that.” As Trump finished his speech, the crowd dispersed, thousands streaming along the mall to the Capitol. On a side street some distance from the crowd, a small group of young bearded men in military fatigues and hats lounged patiently, in readiness for what they knew would come later, when the sun set. It was unknowable, as the glass was being swept up in the Capitol and the police began to eject the jubilant rioters, whether they were the embodiment of a last spasm of a spent force, or the true face of America’s future.",theguardian
27,5,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/georgia-senate-runoff-black-voters-stacey-abrams,Georgia  How Black voters lifted Democrats to Senate runoff victories ,"Black voters showed up in record numbers for Georgia’s Senate runoff election on Tuesday, handing the Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff decisive victories against the Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively. According to the Associated Press, more than 4.4 million votes were cast, about 88% of the number who voted in November’s contest, when turnout was 68 percent overall. Just weeks after flipping the conservative stronghold in the general election, local strategists and community organizers across the state are being credited with once again galvanizing a voting bloc critical in delivering Democrats’ victory. “Black runoff turnout was phenomenal and the [Donald] Trump base just couldn’t keep up,” the political analyst Dave Wasserman tweeted shortly after being one of the first to call the race for Warnock. Tuesday’s win makes the senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist church the first Black senator from Georgia and the first in a former Confederate state since Reconstruction. The milestone is considered by some analysts to be a factor in the surge in participation. Maybe it shouldn't be a surprise, given the stakes of the race and the political moment, but this was a remarkable and high turnout. I mean, yea, there was probably slightly more Trump vote dropoff--see the result--but the turnout in >80% Trump areas was still at 88% of general Black voters in the state were the deciding force in both Democratic victories, particularly in urban and rural communities with large Black populations. Typically, these groups are less likely to vote in state and local contests than their white counterparts. The runoffs garnered national attention after Black voters – along with new Georgia residents of all races – successfully flipped the state from reliably Republican to a competitive purple in November, with the Democrat Joe Biden narrowly winning over the incumbent president by more than 11,000 votes. “The margins are so small that every action, including your vote, matters and will make a difference,” Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, told CNN. “Black voters got that message. Black voters recognized that we need to complete the task.” According to exit polls, turnout for the Senate races was high overall, reaching more than 80% of the turnout in the November general election. That rate was slightly higher in predominantly Black districts. Roughly 93% of Black voters supported Ossoff and Warnock. Ossoff earned 92% of Black voters in Tuesday’s contest compared with 87% in November. According to NBC data, Warnock won 92% of Black voters against Loeffler. Meanwhile, although Republicans Loeffler and Perdue received 71% of the white vote, turnout was slightly down from the general election. “Democrats need to get at least 30% of the white vote to be competitive in any race,” Andra Gillespie, political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, told the Guardian. “But Black voter turnout, when reaching record levels, will ultimately decide the race every time.” Gillespie noted that as Georgia continues to attract young, more liberal populations, residents will see many competitive election cycles to come. According to Pew Research Center, the Black voting bloc has grown to make up a third of Georgia’s electorate in the last two decades. Other analysts also credit new Black residents with making more southern states like North Carolina, and Texas and Florida more competitive. Black women did this—but this isn't just ""Black Girl Magic."" This is the result of pure organizing, labor, and love that Black women have poured into GA.Gratitude to every one of my sisters who willed the possibilities of this moment into existence. We see you and we love you. Front and center amid post-election praise are the former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and the Black Voters Matter founder LaTosha Brown, who, along with Black grassroots organizations, have led campaigns to reach hundreds of thousands of Georgia residents since November’s general election. “Across our state, we roared,” Abrams tweeted as votes were counted, calling on Georgians to “celebrate the extraordinary organizers, volunteers, canvassers & tireless groups that haven’t stopped going”. Adopting a strategy that Brown called “meeting voters where they are”, voting rights activists spent the last weeks traveling to typically low-turnout areas to knock on doors, register voters and combat an onslaught of conservative disinformation attempts. Many advocates say these get-out-the-vote efforts were effective in driving Black voters who otherwise wouldn’t have voted, or perhaps didn’t in November. According to a state vote tracker, more than 100,000 Georgians who didn’t vote in the presidential requested a mail-in ballot for the runoff. Georgia residents largely rejected Republicans Loeffler and Perdue, who backed Trump’s conspiracy theories questioning the election’s legitimacy. Just this week, leaked audio revealed that the president had urged Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to “find” votes that would overturn the election. The president and campaign surrogates have launched dozens of legal challenges, primarily in cities like Atlanta, Philadelphia and Detroit, alleging fraud. In the same vein, both Loeffler and Perdue have refused to concede so far, challenging election results and calling on officials to count every legal vote.  Meanwhile, Raffensperger has maintained that the election was secure and the results accurate. Black. Voters. Matter. Activists argue schemes to toss out votes in primarily Black, Democratic strongholds follow a history of Republican efforts to disenfranchise primarily African Americans. For Georgia activists, Black voters flipping the state and reclaiming Democratic control of the Senate reinforces African Americans’ influence in the conservative south when they show up to the polls. “Black voters matter,” Brown succinctly tweeted.",theguardian
28,6,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/can-trump-be-removed-from-office-before-his-term-ends,Impeachment or the 25th  Can Trump be removed from office? ,"The storming of the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump on Wednesday has prompted calls by some lawmakers to remove him from office before Joe Biden is sworn in on 20 January. The chaotic scenes unfolded after Trump – who has been condemned for inciting violence by spreading falsehoods about the election and refusing to admit defeat – addressed thousands of protesters in Washington, using his speech to repeat lies that the election was stolen from him. The events have renewed questions as to whether Trump could be declared unfit for for office, or charged with a criminal act. There are two ways to remove a president from office: the 25th amendment of the US constitution, and impeachment followed by a Senate conviction. In either scenario, the vice-president, Mike Pence, would take over until Biden’s inauguration. Calls for such a move are already under way from multiple Democrats who urged the invocation of the 25th amendment, while Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democratic congresswoman, said she was drawing up articles of impeachment. Meanwhile, editorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post called for consequences in the form of Trump’s removal. But how would it work, and is it even possible? Here’s what you need to know. The 25th amendment, ratified in 1967 and adopted in the wake of John F Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, deals with presidential succession and disability. Section 4 addresses situations in which a president is unable to do the job but does not step down voluntarily. The drafters of the 25th amendment clearly intended for it to apply when a president is incapacitated by a physical or mental illness, experts say. Some scholars have also argued that it could also apply more broadly to a president who is dangerously unfit for office. For the 25th amendment to be invoked, Pence and the majority of Trump’s cabinet would need to declare that Trump is unable to perform the duties of the presidency and remove him. In that scenario, Pence would take over. Trump could subsequently declare that he is capable of resuming the job. If Pence and the majority of the Cabinet do not contest Trump’s determination, Trump regains power. If they dispute Trump’s declaration, the issue would be decided by Congress, but Pence would continue to act as president until then. A two-thirds majority of both chambers of Congress would be needed to keep Trump sidelined. But the Democratic-controlled House could simply delay voting on the substantive dispute until Trump’s term ends, said Paul Campos, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Colorado. Campos said the 25th amendment would be an appropriate way to remove Trump from office and has the benefit of being quicker than impeachment. “Pence could instantly become president, whereas impeachment and conviction could take at least a few days,” Campos said. Yes. A misconception about “impeachment” is that it refers to the removal of a president from office. In fact, impeachment refers only to the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, bringing charges that a president engaged in a “high crime or misdemeanors” – similar to an indictment in a criminal case. Trump has already been impeached once and could be impeached a second time, for a different crime. If a simple majority of the House’s 435 members approves bringing charges, known as “articles of impeachment”, the process moves to the Senate, the upper chamber, which holds a trial to determine the president’s guilt. The constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict and remove a president. Trump was previously impeached by the Democratic-led US House in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son. Trump was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate in February 2020. Frank Bowman, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Missouri, said Trump “arguably fomented sedition”, or an attempted overthrowing of the US government. But Bowman said Trump could also be impeached for a more general offense: disloyalty to the US constitution and failing to uphold his oath of office. Congress has discretion in defining a high crime and misdemeanor and is not limited to actual criminal offences. “The essential offense would be one against the constitution – one of essentially trying to undermine the lawful results of a lawfully conducted election,” Bowman said.

The Black Lives Matter demonstrators crowd outside the White House on 1 June was a block away from the building and made no attempt to breach its security. It was a mostly Black crowd, and it was charged by a force made up of Washington police, US Park police, over 5,000 national guard troops and federal agencies like the bureau of prisons. An army helicopter swooped low over the heads of the protesters. Teargas, batons and horses were used to clear a block so that Donald Trump could stage a photo op outside a church across the road. A national guard commander later admitted there had been “excessive use of force”. The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021. The mob that stormed the seat of US democracy on Wednesday had openly talked about such a plan, were explicitly intent on overturning a fair election, and some had hinted they might be carrying guns. They were almost all white. Many were openly white supremacists, and yet the thin Capitol police collapsed in their path. The events in Lafayette Park in June 2020 represented a defining moment of the Trump presidency. So will 6 January 2021 It is unknown why there was not a greater show of force in front of the Capitol building, given all that was known about the plans of Trump’s supporters. In the summer, the national guard from several states parked armoured cars in the Washington streets and stood in full body armour in serried ranks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial – all ahead of protests calling for the law to be upheld and an end to impunity for the police killing of Black Americans. The deployment ahead of the 6 January riot was far lighter. After Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, made a request, 340 guardsmen were activated in advance, of which 115 were on duty at any one time, mostly helping direct traffic. The DC and Virginia national guard were only deployed in significant numbers after the Capitol had been breached. One big difference was that Trump was driving the deployment in June. He was silent on Wednesday, apparently unwilling to set troops on his own supporters. The New York Times reported he resisted calling out the national guard. The deployment was finally ordered by the acting secretary of defence, Christopher Miller.

30,10,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/priti-patel-trump-remarks-led-to-violence-in-us-capitol,Priti Patel  Trump's remarks 'led to violence' in US Capitol ,"The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, said Donald Trump’s incendiary remarks directly provoked the violence witnessed in the US Capitol as she urged him to condemn it. “His comments directly led to the violence and so far he has failed to condemn that violence – and that is completely wrong,” she said. She said the departing president’s statement, in which he said “we love you” to the rioters, and repeated his unproven claims of electoral fraud did “very little to de-escalate the situation”. “He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn’t do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever,” she told BBC Breakfast. She called on the US president to condemn the violence from his supporters who stormed the Capitol. “There’s no question about that at all. Someone was shot, people have died, this is terrible. Terrible beyond words, frankly, and there’s no justification for it,” she told Sky News. But pressed on whether the Conservative government had got too close to Trump, she said it was time to look ahead to Joe Biden’s presidency. “The fact of the matter is, they are now transitioning to a new president, to a president-elect. “The prime minister has already been in touch with Joe Biden and certainly congratulated him. I think on that basis alone we move forward with one of our greatest allies in the world,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme. “This isn’t about going back and reflecting on personal relationships.” The fact of the matter is: Donald Trump’s words were associated with violence, his comments directly led to violence. And so far, he has failed to condemn that violence, and that is wrong,” she said. Boris Johnson had earlier called for a “peaceful and orderly transfer of power” after Trump supporters breached barricades and staged an occupation of the home of American democracy in Washington DC. He labelled the scenes “disgraceful”. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, called them “horrendous”. Scotland’s justice minister called on Patel to deny Trump entry to the UK once he leaves office. Humza Yousaf tweeted: “Once he leaves office if Trump tries to come to UK the home secretary should give serious consideration to denying him entry, she has the power if an applicant’s presence is not conducive to the public good. “Trump’s default is to stir up racial tension and yesterday he incited a violent mob.” The president owns two golf courses in Scotland, and on Tuesday the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the country’s travel ban would apply to Trump amid speculation he was planning an overseas golf trip during Biden’s inauguration.",theguardian
31,13,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/jan/07/ground-rent-scandal-leaseholders-in-england-and-wales-get-new-rights,Ground rent scandal  Leaseholders in England and Wales get new rights ,"Leaseholders in England and Wales will be given the right to extend their lease by up to 990 years and pay no ground rent under major changes that the government said would save some households tens of thousands of pounds and make homeownership “fairer and more secure”. The changes follow an outcry several years ago when it emerged some flats and houses had been sold with clauses that meant ground rents would rise dramatically in later years. Around 4.5m households own their homes on a leasehold basis and pay an annual ground rent to the freeholder of the property – often an investment firm – which, through the lease, grants the right of the homeowner to live there. Typically they are set at a low “peppercorn” rate but clauses in some new developments stated that rents would double every 10 years, making some homes unmortgageable, and leaving owners unable to move and facing hefty bills. Currently, leaseholders of houses can only extend their lease for 50 years once and pay a ground rent, while flat owners can do so multiple times with a peppercorn rent for 90 years. Under the reforms, which were recommended by the Law Commission, both will be able to extend to up to 990 years with a ground rent at zero, and all new retirement properties will be sold without a ground rent. Extending a lease comes at a cost, but the government said it would change the way these were calculated, including getting rid of costs such as the “marriage value”, which forces the leaseholder to share a potential profit from the extension with the freeholder. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “Across the country people are struggling to realise the dream of owning their own home but find the reality of being a leaseholder far too bureaucratic, burdensome and expensive. “We want to reinforce the security that home ownership brings by changing forever the way we own homes and end some of the worst practices faced by homeowners.” The Law Commission also proposed the adoption of commonhold ownership as the preferred type of ownership of newbuilds, and the government said it was setting up a council to “prepare homeowners and the market for [its] widespread take-up”. Under this model, which is popular in other parts of the world but has been used on fewer than 20 developments in England and Wales, blocks are jointly owned and managed, and flats can be owned on a freehold basis.",theguardian
32,14,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/07/global-heating-stabilize-net-zero-emissions,"Climate crisis  Global heating could stabilize if net zero emissions achieved, scientists say ","The world may be barreling towards climate disaster but rapidly eliminating planet-heating emissions means global temperatures could stabilize within just a couple of decades, scientists say. For many years it was assumed that further global heating would be locked in for generations even if emissions were rapidly cut. Climate models run by scientists on future temperatures were based on a certain carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. If this remained at the current high level there would be runaway climate disaster, with temperatures continuing to rise even if emissions were reduced because of a lag time before greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. But more recent understanding of the implications of getting to net zero emissions is giving hope that the warming could be more swiftly curtailed. More than 100 countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050, which means they will emit no more carbon dioxide than is removed from the atmosphere by, for example, restoring forests. The UK, Japan and the European Union have set this net zero target and will soon be joined by the US under Joe Biden’s new administration. Should this be achieved globally, “surface temperatures stop warming and warming stabilizes within a couple decades,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “What this really means is that our actions have a direct and immediate impact on surface warming. It grants us agency, which is part of why it is so important to communicate this current best scientific understanding.” Scientists have now factored in the dynamism of the Earth’s natural systems, whereby stopping emissions would actually see atmospheric CO2 content go down due to the huge carbon absorption capacity of oceans, wetlands and forests. Mann likens it to filling up a sink with water with the drain partially open – the water level will still rise due to the incoming water but if you reduce the water flow it will drop due to the drain remaining open. “This falling atmospheric CO2 causes enough cooling to balance out the warming ‘in the pipeline’ due to slow ocean heat uptake, and global temperatures remain relatively flat after net-zero emissions are reached,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate expert at the Breakthrough Institute. “The main takeaway for me is that this is good news, because it means that how much warming happens this century and beyond is up to us.” The disastrous present-day trajectory of the world’s climate has been highlighted by a new paper that shows the world is committed to more than 2C of heating compared with the pre-industrial period based on current atmospheric compositions of greenhouse gases. The world has already heated up by 1.1C in this time and governments have committed to restraining the rise to 1.5C to avoid punishing heatwaves, flooding, mass displacement of people and other calamities. The paper on “committed warming” appears to spell doom for the goals of the Paris climate agreement, as well as for millions of people in vulnerable parts of the world, but the authors point out that cutting emissions would slow the pace of this temperature rise, potentially spanning centuries. This would give civilization time to adapt to the changes or come up with technological fixes. “At the moment we are changing the temperature a hundred times faster than what happened in the last ice age,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University and co-author of the paper, published in Nature Climate Change. “An extra degree in a few hundred years is far less damaging than a degree in a few decades. The timescale is important.” Dessler said he believed there could still be some warming even under net zero emissions but that the goal of decarbonization was vital. “The problem is still very severe, we need to reduce emissions as fast as possible and we will deal with committed warming afterwards,” he said. Joeri Rogelj, a climate lecturer at Imperial College London, said he was confident if the world became net zero in the coming decades it would be possible to remove further CO2 from the atmosphere to push down on escalating temperatures. But he added that “bending the global emissions curve on to a global trajectory towards net zero is really the first and foremost task we have to tackle with great urgency”.",theguardian
33,15,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/07/british-gas-workers-strike-thursday-restructuring-talks,'Fire and hire'  British Gas workers strike after restructuring talks break down ,"Thousands of British Gas engineers and call centre workers will down tools from Thursday as part of a national five-day strike in response to the energy giant’s “fire and rehire” plans. The GMB trade union called the strike after 89% of its 9,000 British Gas members voted in favour of industrial action following the breakdown of talks with executives at Britain’s biggest energy supplier last year. The union expects the majority of the 7,000 engineers and 2,000 call centre workers who are part of its membership to take part, but will limit picketing due to coronavirus restrictions.  The strike marks the end of months of tense negotiations between union representatives and energy company executives over plans to reduce the workforce and shift employees on to new contracts. The union has accused Centrica, the embattled owner of British Gas, of “bullying” its 20,000 employees to accept worse employment contracts or lose their jobs as part of a so-called “fire and rehire” plan. The FTSE-listed company, which has lost more than three-quarters of its market value in the last five years, said it has asked all employees to sign up to new employment contracts to help simplify the business. A similar approach was proposed by British Airways last year, alongside staff cuts, but the airline dropped the controversial plans after negotiations with trade unions. Justin Bowden, GMB’s national secretary, said: “British Gas boss Chris O’Shea’s attempts to bully workers into accepting cuts to their pay and terms and conditions has provoked this inevitable outcome – massive disruption to customers in the depths of winter and a stain on the reputation of an historic company and brand.” About 7,000 frontline office workers represented by the Unison trade union accepted the energy company’s new terms last month, and 4,000 non-unionised staff also agreed to sign new contracts. A spokeswoman for Centrica said: “We’ve done everything we can with the GMB to avoid industrial action. “Whilst we’ve made great progress with our other unions, sadly the GMB leadership seems intent on causing disruption to customers during the coldest weekend of the year, amid a global health crisis and in the middle of a national lockdown.” The company said it has “strong contingency plans in place” and will “prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies”. British Gas has lost about 1 million customers in recent years due to fierce competition in the energy market from a string of cut-price energy supply startups.  As a result, Centrica reported a £1bn loss for 2019 before scrapping its shareholder dividend and warning investors there would be a steep slump in revenues in 2020.",theguardian
34,17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/07/europe-tipping-point-covid-running-rampant-who-new-variant,"Europe  Region at tipping point with Covid running rampant, says WHO ","Europe is at a tipping point in the course of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said, warning that the coronavirus is spreading very fast across the continent and the arrival of a new variant has created an “alarming situation”. Hans Kluge, the WHO’s Europe director, said that while the arrival of vaccines offered “new tools” to fight the virus, almost half the 53 countries in the region were reporting a seven-day incidence rate of more than 150 new cases per 100,000 people, while a quarter had recorded a more than 10% surge in cases over the past week. Kluge said countries rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine could be flexible on the gap between first and second doses, saying a balance should be struck between making the most of limited supplies and protecting as many people as possible. Some countries including Britain are seeking to counter low vaccine supplies by extending the gap between first and second doses to up to 12 weeks, and by considering lower volume doses of some shots.“It is important such a decision represents a safe compromise between the limited global production capacity at the moment, and the imperative for governments to protect as many people as possible while reducing the burden of any subsequent wave on health systems,” he said. Proposals to prolong the gap between first and second dose have generated fierce debate among scientists, with both Pfizer and BioNTech warning that they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose was given more than 21 days after the first. Siddhartha Datta, of the WHO’s vaccine-preventable diseases and immunisation unit, said the organisation acknowledged that some countries would face “exceptional circumstances”, but those choosing to prioritise first doses were “strongly recommended … to look into robust evidence” of the consequences. The European region recorded more than 580,000 deaths from Covid in 2020, while the 27 countries in the EuroMOMO excess mortality monitoring project reported a threefold increase in excess deaths compared with 2018 and a fivefold increase over 2019. Any signs of stabilisation or even decreased incidence in some countries “need to be taken with some caution” because the impact of the holiday period, with its family gatherings and relaxed physical distancing, was not yet known, Kluge said. More than 230 million people in the region were living in countries under full national lockdowns, he said, with more countries set to announce new measures in the coming week as the more contagious variant first detected in the UK raises increasing alarm. The mutation had been detected in 22 European countries, Kluge said, adding that while it seemed to produce no significant change in the disease itself – meaning it was “not more nor less dangerous” – its higher transmissibility was cause for concern. “It is our assessment it may, over time, replace other lineages, as seen in the UK and increasingly Denmark,” he said. Without increased control to slow its spread, there would be an increased impact on already struggling health systems. “This is an alarming situation,” he said. “For a short period of time, we need to do more than we have done and to intensify the public health and social measures to be certain we can flatten the steep vertical line in some countries.” Basic measures such as mask wearing, limiting social gatherings, physical distancing and hand washing, along with testing, tracing and quarantine, must be intensified “to bring down transmission, lift the strain on Covid-19 wards and save lives”. Kluge said progress on rolling out Covid vaccines was “varied but promising”, adding that the limited supply of jabs and increasing burden on hospitals meant health workers and at-risk groups “must be a priority” for vaccinations to avoid health systems collapsing. Catherine Smallwood, WHO Europe’s senior emergency officer, said that although studies were still ongoing, there was “no indication for the moment” of any impact of the new strain on the efficacy of vaccines.",theguardian
35,19,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/07/covid-kills-half-of-sussex-care-homes-residents-over-christmas,Sussex  Covid kills half of care home's residents over Christmas ,"A care home in East Sussex has been devastated by Covid, losing half of all its residents to the disease over Christmas, fuelling fears the new, more transmissible virus variant sweeping the south-east of England is beginning to breach homes’ defences. Thirteen of 27 residents at Edendale Lodge care home in Crowhurst had died with confirmed or suspected Covid since 13 December, said the home operator’s managing director, Adam Hutchison, who also runs care homes in Kent. More than a third of the staff also tested positive during the outbreak in which residents died on Christmas Eve and Boxing Day. The latest death came on Monday this week. “It was an awful Christmas and terrible for the staff,” Hutchison said. “It is just unstoppable. We are sitting ducks.” Across England, Covid outbreaks in care homes are rising again, after months of far lower infection rates than in the spring as a result of control measures. On Tuesday, Essex county council banned all visits to care homes in its area, citing “the growing number of outbreaks in care homes and the difficulty in controlling these outbreaks”. The Kent Integrated Care Alliance, which represents care homes in its area, is also warning of deaths and care worker absences, emotional and mental exhaustion among care workers and a threat to the viability of care homes themselves. Many care homes are frustrated that vaccines are yet to be deployed to residents. Boris Johnson told parliament on Wednesday he wanted the programme to be accelerated and that 10% of care home residents and 14% of care home staff had so far received the vaccine. “That clearly needs to be stepped up,” the PM said. GPs were due to start taking the AstraZeneca vaccine to care homes from the second half of this week. Hutchison said several of the deceased residents in the home had been considered to be close to the end of their lives, but the virus took them months before they were likely to have died. Others were fitter. “One of our residents played the piano and I would speak to him when I went in,” he said . The outbreak was detected by routine swab testing. None of the 14 residents who tested positive had any symptoms when the results came back, Hutchison said. One of the 12 staff who tested positive was admitted to hospital but was recovering. The outbreak appears to have confounded the home’s infection control measures, including a ban on visits, apart from at windows, personal protective equipment for carers and no use of agency staff who operate between different homes and might spread the virus. “It’s hard for me to say how it got in,” said Hutchison. “Because of the protocols we were following, everything was there.” He said some residents had attended hospital appointments and that staff necessarily had lives outside of work. His company, Belmont Healthcare, operates four care homes and asks staff to declare if they have second jobs. Care home deaths across England rose steadily during December and at a slightly faster rate than deaths overall from Covid, official figures show. At the beginning of December, care homes in England recorded 440 people who died from Covid in a week, rising to 588 by the week before Christmas, according to the Office for National Statistics. While the figures are far higher than in the last week of September, when only 42 people died from Covid, they remain a fraction of the up to 2,700 care home residents registered as dying weekly from Covid at the pandemic’s first peak in April, when there was also less testing to identify cases. HC-One, the largest private operator of care homes in the UK, said on Tuesday that a third of its 330 care homes were facing outbreaks, but mostly with limited numbers of people infected and more staff than residents testing positive. It has fewer homes in the south-east than in the north and its outbreak rates have fallen over the last month. Across the UK, visits have been largely prohibited in care homes unless residents are close to the end of their lives or infection control screens or cubicles have been set up. Homes have also been provided with free PPE by the government and a network of care homes specialising in accepting Covid-positive discharges from hospitals to try and avoid seeding the virus among the most vulnerable has been set up. In the current lockdown, close-contact indoor visits are not allowed, with window or cubicle visits also banned during outbreaks. Hutchison said that as well as the human cost, he was concerned care homes affected by new outbreaks “will simply have to close down”. “What happens to those already in unviable care homes?” he said. “Where will those individuals go? More often than not into an NHS setting, putting further stress on that health service.” ",theguardian
36,23,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/07/lockdown-choices-are-not-trivial-vaughan-gething-on-tackling-covid-crisis-in-wales,'Lockdown choices are not trivial'  Vaughan Gething on tackling Covid crisis in Wales ,"In the past year, Vaughan Gething has become one of the most recognisable politicians in the UK. The job of Welsh health minister did not used to attract much UK-wide attention. But as a result of Covid, and the focus that has placed on the devolved nations, it does now. “Some government colleagues ask me: ‘How do you do that job? It’s awful.’ Of course it’s difficult, but you make a difference and you meet remarkable people who benefit from the health service and remarkable people who deliver it.” But with recognition also comes abuse. Gething, like many other politicians, now regularly gets vitriol from the public, none more so than after “Chipgate”, when the Sun carried a picture during the first lockdown of Gething sitting on a bench eating chips with his family in a park. He insists he broke no rules. “There’s much more attention, and attention that is personal. That’s difficult, the feeling that you’re being watched and not in a kind way.”  But what keeps Gething, 46, going is that decisions he makes during the Covid crisis can be the difference between hospitals being able to function or being overwhelmed, between the economy creaking on or collapsing, between life and death. The latest figures suggest the number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals could soon be double that seen during the first wave of the pandemic. On Wednesday, Public Health Wales reported another 76 deaths – the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic, although not all deaths happened on the same day. It took the total deaths in Wales since the start of the pandemic to 3,738. Speaking shortly before the latest surge, Gething said: “The lockdown choices are not trivial; they have a huge impact on people. And there are people who potentially won’t be alive because we’ve chosen to act or not act. I don’t think I’ve been overwhelmed but I’ve been deeply troubled by the choices I’ve had to make at various times.” He pays tribute not just to health and social care staff. “It’s the volunteers, the taxi drivers who take shopping to people who can’t get out, it’s the community groups who made an effort to look after other people. That is what gives hope and optimism for the future.” Gething accepts the crisis has exposed some “fragility” in parts of the system and highlighted deep health issues in the Welsh population. “This virus affects older people with underlying health conditions. There’s a very direct link between that and how well off you are. The poorer you are the more likely you are to be unwell. The ONS figures show it’s our poorer communities that have had the biggest impact. It’s highlighted a need to look again at what we do, that’s not just a health challenge but a whole society challenge.” But Gething argues some good things have come out of the Covid crisis such as partnerships between health and central and local government. “Necessity forced the relationships to improve to take another leap forward.” And the speed with which some innovations such as video consultations have come in. “Previously that would have taken years to roll out. It was done in months. There’s been a real can-do attitude. ” As a result, “there’s much more UK attention on Wales and devolution. Not every UK-wide news organisation has a benevolent view of devolution or of politicians who don’t agree with the UK government. Some of that has been personal and pretty fact-free.” After Chipgate, “a couple of months ago I went on a bike ride with my son and it’s a nice thing to do together, have a chat, have a snack. But someone tweeted about seeing me on the bike ride and claimed I was breaking the rules.” On another occasion he went to a food festival with his family, following all the rules. Again a picture appeared on social media suggesting he was doing something he shouldn’t. “That’s hurtful. They can see you’re out with a child of primary school age child they are still prepared to lay in and invite other people to be unkind, never mind the facts.” In 2013 Gething became the first black minister in the devolved UK administrations. Before that he was the first black president of the National Union of Students Wales and the first black president of the Trades Union Congress in Wales. He says that some of the abuse he receives is racist. He says he has nothing like the “sewer of filth” the likes of his Labour colleague Diane Abbott is subject to. “But some of what comes is because I’m black. There’s no getting away from that.” Despite the stress of his current job, Gething still harbours ambitions of becoming Welsh first minister one day. “I haven’t given up on my desire to lead the country but that will be a matter for another day. We have a lot to get through before then – not just the Covid pandemic but an election [there are due to be Welsh parliament elections in 2021] and a lot of uncertainty. Who knows what the world will be like in another few years.”",theguardian
37,25,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/07/sainsburys-reports-strong-christmas-sales-as-essential-retailers-gain,Sainsbury's  Supermarket reports strong Christmas sales as essential retailers gain ,"Sainsbury’s upgraded its profit expectations by £60m after surging sales of champagne, steaks and other luxury food drove stronger than expected sales over Christmas and new year.  The UK’s second largest supermarket reported that like-for-like sales jumped by a stronger-than-expected 9.3% year-on-year during its Christmas period, from 1 November through to 2 January.  Supermarkets have been one of the main beneficiaries of consumer spending during the coronavirus pandemic, as locked-down shoppers spent extra money on groceries that they would usually have spent in pubs, restaurants and cafes. Bradford-based supermarket Morrisons on Tuesday reported a big sales increase, while the retail analysts Kantar said December was a record month for UK supermarkets. Despite soaring revenues, profits have been held back by significant extra costs involved in delivering social distancing measures and covering for self-isolating staff. Supermarkets have also expanded home delivery as online sales have boomed. Sainsbury’s said its online grocery sales had increased by 128% year-on-year in the 15 weeks to 2 January to make up 18% of sales over the Christmas period compared with about 7% a year ago. Sainsbury’s delivered 1.1m orders in the 10 days to Christmas, double the number of last year. Sainsbury’s raised its profit guidance, saying it now expected to make an underlying profit before tax of at least £330m in the financial year to March 2021 compared with £270m previously expected. It was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Thursday, with shares gaining more than 4% in morning trading. Despite the upgrade, Sainsbury’s profits will be down 44% year-on-year because of higher costs and after the supermarket belatedly pledged to pay back £410m in business rates relief given by the government at the start of the pandemic. The relief had been given on the expectation that supermarkets and other retailers would suffer, but essential shops that remained open instead reported sales increase. Sainsbury’s, B&M and a host of other retailers only pledged to pay back the relief after a public outcry. Sainsbury’s said premium champagne sales rose by 52%, while party food under its “Taste the Difference” premium food brand increased by 11%. Mincemeat sales soared 24% as Britons turned to home baking to cope with lockdown boredom. Sales of turkey were down as more families bought alternatives such as lamb or beef to cater to smaller gatherings under government restrictions. The supermarket also reported a record number of steaks sold in the run-up to New Year’s Eve, as UK shoppers were mostly confined to their homes. Sales of general merchandise rose 6%, thanks to a strong performance in Argos outlets which has kept stores partially open to enable shoppers to pick up online orders. Even clothing sales rose – by 0.4% – despite widespread difficulties in the market as events were cancelled and many worked from home. Simon Roberts, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said the company was “dealing with a lot of change and uncertainty again” during England’s third national lockdown, when he said staff absences were likely to rise above about 8% at present. He said the government “frontline workers” such as supermarket staff and teachers should be among those prioritised for vaccination. “Priority should be given to those that need it first. Those on the frontline should be part of that when and if capability is available,” he said. Roberts said that the end of Brexit transition had not led to problems with the flow of goods from Europe so far but there had been some problems in sending goods to Northern Ireland, where the group has had to supplement its own products with locally-sourced Spar items. He said the group was “working through administrative change”. Roberts cautioned that the flow of imports from Europe was low at present and would not be back up to normal levels until the third week of January, suggesting that any issues with new paperwork on imports from the EU might emerge then. Dr Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it was “a quite fabulous trading update from Sainsbury’s. It is really is some decades since we have been able to make that statement.” He said that not only sales were better than expected but also gross profit margins on general merchandise and clothing.",theguardian
38,26,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jan/07/leisure-facilities-face-90m-a-week-loss-under-uk-winter-covid-19-lockdown,Sport  Leisure facilities face £90m a week loss under UK winter Covid-19 lockdown ,"The winter lockdown will cost Britain’s gyms, swimming pools and leisure facilities a combined £90m a week in lost revenue, according to new analysis from ukactive, which is calling for urgent government help to protect jobs and keep the sector afloat. January is a vital month for the leisure industry, with many people renewing gym or pool memberships or committing to a new exercise programme. But with most sports banned for another six weeks – and possibly longer – ukactive, which represents more than 4,000 gyms and leisure facilities, said the industry was in deep trouble. “The government must protect this sector as a priority, before it becomes too late,” the ukactive chief executive, Huw Edwards, said. “January and February represent a vital period for gyms, pools, and leisure facilities to trade but they currently have zero income, unlike other sectors.” Last autumn the government announced a £100m fund across the sector while on Monday the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, revealed one-off grants of £9,000 for small businesses would also be made available. But ukactive says that help is nowhere near enough. “The top-up grants and funding announced by the Chancellor, while welcome, will be no more than a sticking plaster for the financial challenges being faced,” Edwards said. “Both public and private fitness and leisure operators will require additional, tailored financial and regulatory support for their recovery.” Meanwhile new research from 4Global, which provides data analysis to governments and sporting bodies, has found the November lockdown restrictions on the sports industry cost Britain £29m in terms of social value – a figured based on the sector’s contribution to the reduction, through exercise, of health conditions such as depression, diabetes and breast and colon cancer. This, said Edwards, showed the closure of gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools during January and February did not only present a “major threat to thousands of facilities and jobs, but also our nation’s health, and resilience to conditions including Covid-19, obesity and some cancers”. Edwards also pointed to evidence from the first lockdown in England, which showed anxiety levels doubled compared with the 2019 average – with an extra 3.2 million people classed as inactive, undertaking less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, as further evidence for more government support. The government has also been urged by the Youth Sports Trust to do more to help young people to stay active. Meanwhile the sports scientist Greg Whyte has told the Guardian that Britain is heading for a “perfect storm” in which a reduction in activity levels during the winter lockdown has a disastrous effect on physical and mental health. Whyte has also called on the government to use the 400,000 people who work in the fitness sector but are on furlough to get the population more active.",theguardian
39,27,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/07/robert-webb-doctor-heart-fail-back-sitcom-booze-twitter,Robert Webb  'The doctor said my heart was about to fail. That got my attention' ,"Robert Webb is talking, rather casually, about how he almost died during the making of the much delayed and highly anticipated second season of his sitcom Back. “I went for the cast medical,” he says, “and the GP put his stethoscope on my heart, pulled a face, and said, ‘Interesting. What have you been doing about the heart murmur?’ And I said, ‘What heart murmur?’ Then he referred me – quite urgently – to a cardiologist, who did a couple of tests and told me, ‘I’m not saying you’re going to have a heart attack in the next fortnight – but in the next two to four to six months, this heart will fail.’” He pauses. “So that got my attention.” What swiftly followed was emergency surgery to fix his mitral valve, which had a birth defect, followed by three and a half months signed off work. And then, three weeks after he returned, Covid happened and the production was forced to shut down once again. The finishing touches were finally put to the series in September. But continuity was somewhat compromised. “There are scenes,” says Webb, “where I look incredibly pasty and bloated and fucked, because my heart had almost doubled in size.” Happily, he looks much healthier now: thinner, younger, more alert. And it’s great that Back is, well, back, not least because it affords Webb the chance to play the most interesting character of his career: Andrew, a man who enters a community claiming to be the long-lost foster brother of Stephen, the owner of a pub in Stroud, played by David Mitchell. It is never made explicitly clear whether or not he is, in fact, a malevolent but charming, mad man. “I still haven’t decided,” says Webb. “And I have an intuition that it’s important I don’t. Is Andrew entirely motivated by malice? Is he basically Satan? Or is it that he had a tough childhood, and he’s a people pleaser, and he just goes around trying to get attention from people in a slightly harmful way that he hasn’t really thought through?” I'd turn up at the pub at midday for lunch, which would be me smoking, drinking lager and getting into fights on Twitter In the first series, Webb had to do two takes for each scene, one hinting at psychopathy and one not. This time, they played it down the middle and show Andrew’s human side as often as possible. The result is a series that’s warmer, slightly. It’s still very, very funny. Writer Simon Blackwell has managed to strap on a heftily traditional sitcom to all the mystery and intrigue, and it’s supported by a great cast. I tell Webb how much I enjoyed Geoff McGivern’s performance as a loudmouth farmer, which causes him to roll his eyes. “It’s fucking Super Hans all over again, isn’t it?” he replies, referring to the mildly deranged, scene-stealing character in Peep Show. “I’m doing all the fucking hard work: ‘Oh, why not have a bit more exposition, maybe I’ll say what’s going to happen in the next scene?’ And then here comes the funny actor who everyone likes, saying something outrageous, and that’ll be everybody’s favourite character. Oh, shut up, Geoff. Fuck off.’” Webb suddenly exhales deeply, just as I’m starting to worry about his heart, and everything returns to normal. “Geoff’s brilliant,” he says calmly. It’s also nice to see Webb acting again given that, around the time of the publication of his novel Come Again last spring, he kept saying he was primarily a novelist now. “I might hastily backtrack from that,” he squirms. It turns out that much of that decision to pick up the pen was due to the state of his health. “Even though it came as a surprise that I had such a serious problem with my heart, I knew I was unwell,” he says. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is what it feels like when you’re 47 and you’re really still caning the booze and the fags.’ As a result of that, I was turning down acting work because subconsciously I thought, ‘I’m not fit to do this.’ There were a couple of West End plays I didn’t do because I thought the press night might kill me.” How badly was he caning the booze and fags? “I’m a bit uncomfortable with the term alcoholic,” he says, “because I was drinking exactly the same as all my friends. You’re in the pub and you have two or three pints, or three or four pints, or whatever, and you have a bit of a hangover. I was doing that all through my 20s and 30s. And then, I don’t know, 40, 42, 43. Suddenly, the time of day when I would start moved earlier and earlier, until I’d get out of bed at eight in the morning – there just wasn’t a bad time of the day or night to have a drink.” Although he’d been fruitlessly attempting to kick the booze for a while, heart surgery gave him all the impetus he needed. “It was the gap in the domino topple that I needed,” he says. “They literally turned me off and on. They put me under general anaesthetic for many, many hours, then brought me back to life. It’s an extraordinary thing, so that was the line in the sand for me.” Webb, who turned 48 last September, now runs three miles five times a week and does resistance training supervised by cardiac coaches. He no longer drinks and has quit cigarettes. This has helped to put him in the right frame of mind to tackle some other personal issues. “Having got rid of a couple of addictions,” he says, “I’m very aware that Twitter is an addiction. And it’s not something that makes me happy. I associate it with the bad old days, because I was never happier than when – actually, I wasn’t happy, but it was my habit to turn up at the pub at midday for lunch, which would just be me smoking and drinking lager and getting into fights on Twitter. It was a shit way to spend the day.” Starting fights on Twitter was something that Webb got quite good at, wading in to arguments about Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn and Ukip with thudding regularity. But now he has decided not to publish every opinion that enters his mind. “If you’re talking about anything important, there’s nothing you can say that bad faith actors won’t be able to put a spin on and say, ‘Look at this fucking cockhead laughing at X, Y, or Z.’ But if you don’t do that, then you turn into a sort of DJ. If I’m not careful, I’m going, ‘Oh, remember Caramac?’ I might as well be Steve Wright. The number of times I’ve started to tweet something and then gone, ‘Oh, shut up.’ And if that’s how I feel, then imagine how the people who can’t stand me must feel.” Even Webb’s relationship with Mitchell has improved. “Going back to 2006 and 2007, when we were massively busy and Mitchell and Webb was in its pomp, we saw each other every day. For people who are not in love and are not having sex, that is a lot of time together. So we did get sick of the sight of each other. We never had the row – we managed to avoid that, but it was challenging.” And now? “It’s brilliant, because we get a chance to miss each other. Then when I see him, it’s nice to see him for the sake of seeing him.” Back is unlikely ever to be the phenomenon that Peep Show was, but Webb is even quite comfortable with that. “Peep Show was a really, really good show, and I’m just very, very proud to be so closely associated with it,” he says. “Parts like Jeremy don’t come along often. That’s a career right there – to be able to play that part on TV for 12 years. It was fantastic.” While it’s a pleasure to see Webb so healthy and content, it does come as something of a relief to see that he can still find things to be grumpy about, such as Back’s difficult production. “We’re hoping it will go out in January, but maybe a tsunami will swallow London,” he huffs. “And then there’ll be another four or five years before series three.” Back starts on Channel 4 on 21 January.",theguardian
40,29,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/07/the-joys-of-being-an-absolute-beginner-for-life,The long read  Joy of being an absolute beginner – for life ,"One day a number of years ago, I was deep into a game of draughts on holiday with my daughter, then almost four, in the small library of a beachfront town. Her eye drifted to a nearby table, where a black-and-white board bristled with far more interesting figures (many a future chess master has been innocently drawn in by “horses” and “castles”). “What’s that?” she asked. “Chess,” I replied. “Can we play?” she pleaded. I nodded absently. There was just one problem: I didn’t know how. I dimly remembered having learned the basic moves as a kid, but chess had never stuck. This fact vaguely haunted me through my life. I would see an idle board in a hotel lobby or a puzzle in a weekend newspaper supplement, and feel a pang. I had picked up a general awareness of chess. I knew the names Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. I knew that the game had enchanted historical luminaries including Marcel Duchamp and Vladimir Nabokov. I knew the cliche about grandmasters being able to look a dozen moves ahead. I knew that chess, like classical music, was shorthand in movies for genius – often of the evil variety. But I knew chess the way I “knew” the Japanese language: what it looks like, what it sounds like, its Japaneseness, without actually comprehending it. I decided to learn the game, if only to be able to teach my daughter.  It took a few hours, hunched over my smartphone at kids’ birthday parties or waiting in line at Trader Joe’s, to get a feel for the basic moves. Soon, I was playing, and some-times even beating, the weakest computer opponents (the ones with catastrophic blunders abundantly programmed in). Yet it soon became apparent that I had little concept of the larger strategies. I didn’t want to try to teach what I knew only poorly. And yet, how to learn? The number of chess books was dauntingly huge. Sure, there was Chess for Dummies. But beyond that, the chess literature was enormous. It was filled with algebraic-looking thickets of chess notation, a quasi-language that itself had to be learned. And the books were achingly specific: for example, A Complete Guide to Playing 3 Nc3 Against the French Defence. That’s right: an entire book devoted to the permutations of a single move – a move that, I should add, has been regularly played for a century. Yet people were still figuring out, 100 years and many chess books later – 288 pages’ worth of new things to say about it. A well travelled fact that one hears early in chess is that after only three moves, there are more possible game variations than there are atoms in the universe. And, indeed, I felt cosmically stupefied as I tried to figure out how to boil down this exponentially complex game to someone whose favourite show was Curious George. So I did what any self-respecting modern parent does: I hired a coach. The twist was that I wanted someone to teach my daughter and me at the same time. For most of us, the beginner stage is something to be got through as quickly as possible, like a socially awkward skin condition. But even if we’re only passing through, we should pay particular attention to this moment. For once it goes, it’s hard to get back. Think of a time when you first visited a new, distant place, one with which you were barely familiar. Upon arrival, you were alive to every novelty. The smell of the food in the street! The curious traffic signs! The sound of the call to prayer! Flushed from the comfort of your usual surrounds, forced to learn new rituals and ways to communicate, you gained sensory superpowers. You paid attention to everything because you didn’t even know what you needed to know to get by. After a few days, as you became more expert in the place, what seemed strange began to become familiar. You began noticing less. You became safer in your knowledge. Your behaviour became more automatic. Even as your skills and knowledge progress, there is a potential value to holding on to that beginner’s mind. In what’s come to be known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, the psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger showed that on various cognitive tests the people who did the worst were also the ones who most “grossly overestimated” their actual performance. They were “unskilled and unaware of it”. This can certainly be a stumbling block for beginners. But additional research later showed that the only thing worse than hardly knowing anything was knowing a little bit more. This pattern appears in the real world: doctors learning a spinal surgery technique committed the most errors not on the first or second try, but on the 15th; pilot errors, meanwhile, seem to peak not in the earliest stages but after about 800 hours of flight time. I’m not suggesting experts have much to fear from beginners. Experts, who tend to be “skilled, and aware of it”, are much more efficient in their problem-solving processes, more efficient in their movement (the best chess players, for example, tend also to be the best speed-chess players). They can draw upon more experience, and more finely honed reflexes. Beginner chess players will waste time considering a huge range of possible moves, while grandmasters zero in on the most relevant options (even if they then spend a lot of time calculating which of those moves are best). And yet, sometimes, the “habits of the expert”, as the Zen master Suzuki called it, can be an obstacle – particularly when new solutions are demanded. With all their experience, experts can come to see what they expect to see. Chess experts can become so entranced by a move they remember from a previous game that they miss a more optimal move on a different part of the board. This tendency for people to default to the familiar, even in the face of a more optimal novel solution, has been termed the Einstellung effect (after a German word that means “set”). In the famous “candle problem”, people are asked to attach a candle to the wall using nothing more than a box of matches and a box of tacks. People struggle to solve it because they get hung up on the “functional fixedness” of the box as a container for tacks, not as a theoretical shelf for the candle. There is one group, it turns out, that tends to do pretty well on the candle problem: five-year-olds. Why? The researchers who found this suggest that younger children have a more fluid “conception of function” than older children or adults. They are less hung up on things being for something, and more able to view them simply as things to be used in all sorts of ways. Small wonder they conquer new technology so handily; everything is new for them. Children, in a very real sense, have beginners’ minds, open to wider possibilities. They see the world with fresher eyes, are less burdened with preconception and past experience, and are less guided by what they know to be true. They are more likely to pick up details that adults might discard as irrelevant. Because they’re less concerned with being wrong or looking foolish, children often ask questions that adults won’t ask. No one wants to stay a beginner. We all want to get better. But even as our skills improve, and our knowledge and experience grow, what I hope to encourage is the preservation, or even cultivation, of that spirit of the novice: the naive optimism, the hypervigilant alertness that comes with novelty and insecurity, the willingness to look foolish, and the permission to ask obvious questions – the unencumbered beginner’s mind. What the chess master Benjamin Blumenfeld advised a century ago applies as much to life as to chess: “Before you make your move, look at the position as if you were a beginner.” When my daughter first began competing in school chess tournaments, I would often chat to other parents. Sometimes, I’d ask if they played chess themselves. Usually, the reply was an apologetic shrug and a smile. When I volunteered that I was learning to play, the tone was cheerily patronising: “Good luck with that!” I thought: “If this game is so good for kids, why are adults ignoring it?” Seeing someone playing Angry Birds, I wanted to tap them on the shoulder and say: “Why are you having your kids do chess while you do that? This is the game of kings! There are chess games recorded from the 15th century!” At chess tournaments, I saw a dynamic that was all too familiar from the world of children’s activities: kids doing the activity, and adults like me staring into their smartphones. Sure, we parents had work to do, work that we allowed to spill into weekends, work that helped pay for the lessons our kids were enjoying (or enduring). But I also wondered if we, in our constant chaperoning of these lessons, were imparting a subtle lesson: that learning was for the young. Strolling down the hall during one tournament, I looked into a classroom and saw a group of parents with what I took to be an instructor. They were playing chess! Just then, as if on cue, a group of kids passed me, peering in on the same scene. “Why are adults learning chess?” one asked, in a vaguely mocking tone, to the collective amusement of the group. They marched on while I slowly died in front of a cheery bulletin board. I was tired of sitting on the sidelines. I wanted in. And that is how I got a membership card from the US Chess Federation and started throwing myself in. Early on, I was nervous, even though I really had nothing to lose, save my pride. “A master can sometimes play badly,” as one grandmaster put it, “a fan, never!” And fan I was: the sombre rituals, the pulse-pounding encounters, the tense atmosphere. It was three hours of sustained concentration and intense thinking, with my phone turned off. It felt like a gym for the brain. Being a beginner can be hard at any age, but it gets harder as you get older. Children’s brains and bodies are built for doing, failing, and doing again. We applaud virtually anything they do, because they are trying. With adults, it’s more complicated. The phrase “adult beginner” has an air of gentle pity. It reeks of obligatory retraining seminars and uncomfortable chairs. It implies the learning of something that you should have perhaps already learned. There is safety in sticking with what we’re already good at. “It’s hard to be old and bad at something,” as a friend, returning to hockey after many decades, put it. We can be so put off by being a beginner that we forget we were once beginners in all sorts of things, until we were not. Adult beginners face their own version of what is known by sporting coaches as “stereotype threat”, whereby a negative image becomes associated with a particular group of players, and leads them to repeat mistakes – in this case, one that says it’s harder to learn when you’re older. There’s a pernicious, goading little voice: “You’ve started too late. Why bother?” One day, at her swimming lesson, I was impressed to see my daughter “flip turn” at the end of the lane while doing a backstroke. This is not something I can do. “How’d you learn to do that?” I asked. “You have to be a kid,” she responded matter-of-factly. As I was finding out, this kind of idea is deeply ingrained in chess. There seems to be a relation between the age at which you first learned the game and your later success in tournaments. This idea is so pervasive that Magnus Carlsen, the current No 1, is held as a fascinating outlier. “At five years old,” one account marvels, “an age by which any aspiring grandmaster should at least have made a start, Magnus Carlsen showed little interest in chess.” Sitting down against younger opponents, I tried to keep in mind a bit of advice gleaned from the Guardian writer Stephen Moss’s book The Rookie: just face them the way you would anyone else. This could be hard. The way they played just threw me. In the face of my agonised dithering, they would launch fast, brute-force attacks – sometimes effective, sometimes foolhardy. “Children just kind of go for it,” Daniel King, the English grandmaster and chess commentator, told me. “That kind of confidence can be very disconcerting for the opponent.” Young children, for example, have been shown to be faster and more accurate at tests involving “probabilistic sequence learning” – the sort in which people must guess which triggers will lead to what events (for example, if you press button A, event X will happen). After the age of 12, this ability begins to decline. As researchers suggest, people start relying more on “internal models” of cognition and reasoning, instead of what they see right in front of them. In other words, they overthink things. In chess games, where my adult opponents often seemed to battle unseen internal demons, the kids just seemed to twitch out a series of moves. I was buying into the stereotype threat. If I lost to an adult, I would chalk it up to my own stupid errors. But if I lost to a child, I would suddenly imagine them as some incipient genius against whom I never had a chance. When I asked our chess coach about what it was like to teach adult chess beginners as opposed to child chess beginners, he thought for a moment and said: “Adults need to explain to themselves why they play what they play.” Kids, he said, “don’t do that”. He compared it to languages: “Beginner adults learn the rules of grammar and pronunciation and use those to put sentences together. Little kids learn languages by talking.” The analogy goes deeper than we might think. My daughter was, in effect, learning chess like a first language, whereas I was learning it like a second language. Even more important, she was learning it young. Language is one of those endeavours (like music, and perhaps chess) that seems to flourish best if learned during a so-called “sensitive period” in which, as one researcher has described it, “neural systems are particularly responsive to relevant stimuli, and are more susceptible to change when stimulated”. By contrast, because I am an adult, expert speaker of English, my brain may be so “tuned” to the sounds of my native language that it is harder for me to take on new grammar. What I know already gets in the way of what I want to learn. Kids, by knowing less, can actually learn more (the cognitive scientist Elissa Newport calls it the “less-is-more hypothesis”). Harder does not mean impossible. “Sensitive” periods are not “critical” periods, and the science, in any case, is not conclusive. The skill of having perfect pitch, for example, which is not only exceedingly rare but has long been thought to be impossible outside a narrow age range in childhood, can be trained in some adults, as research from the University of Chicago has shown (albeit to not quite as high a level as those possessing “true” perfect pitch). Kids often make more progress simply because they are kids, with lives built largely around learning, having few other responsibilities, and with eager parents to cheer them on. They are also motivated: if you were dropped into an entirely new setting, the way infants are, and found that you couldn’t communicate, you’d probably learn pretty quickly. You may, by now, be rightly asking, why should I bother learning a bunch of things that aren’t relevant to my career? Why dabble in mere hobbies when I’m scrambling to keep up with the demands of a rapidly changing workplace? First, I might suggest that it’s not at all clear that learning something like singing or drawing actually won’t help you in your job – even if it’s not immediately obvious how. Learning has been proposed as an effective response to stress in one’s job. By enlarging one’s sense of self, and perhaps equipping us with new capabilities, learning becomes a “stress buffer”. Claude Shannon, the brilliant MIT polymath who helped invent the digital world in which we live today, plunged into all kinds of pursuits, from juggling to poetry to designing the first wearable computer. “Time and time again,” noted his biographer, “he pursued projects that might have caused others embarrassment, engaged questions that seemed trivial or minor, then managed to wring breakthroughs out of them.” Regularly stepping out of our comfort zones, at this historical moment, just feels like life practice. The fast pace of technological change turns us all, in a sense, into “perpetual novices”, always on the upward slope of learning, our knowledge constantly requiring upgrades, like our phones. Few of us can channel our undivided attention into a lifelong craft. Even if we keep the same job, the required skills change. The more willing we are to be brave beginners, the better. As Ravi Kumar, president of the IT giant Infosys, described it: “You have to learn to learn, learn to unlearn, and learn to re-learn.” Second, it’s just good for you. I don’t mean only the things themselves – the singing or the drawing or the surfing – are good for you (although they are, in ways I’ll return to). I mean that skill learning itself is good for you. It scarcely matters what it is – tying nautical knots or throwing pottery. Learning something new and challenging, particularly with a group, has proven benefits for the “novelty-seeking machine” that is the brain. Because novelty itself seems to trigger learning, learning various new things at once might be even better. A study that had adults aged 58 to 86 simultaneously take multiple classes – ranging from Spanish to music composition to painting – found that after just a few months, the learners had improved not only at Spanish or painting, but on a battery of cognitive tests. They’d rolled back the odometers in their brains by some 30 years, doing better on the tests than a control group who took no classes. They’d changed in other ways, too: they felt more confident, they were pleasantly surprised by their work, and they kept getting together after the study ended. Skill learning seems to be additive; it’s not only about the skill. A study that looked at young children who had taken swimming lessons found benefits beyond swimming. The swimmers were better at a number of other physical tests, such as grasping or hand-eye coordination, than non-swimmers. They also did better on reading and mathematical reasoning tests than non-swimmers, even accounting for factors such as socio-economic status. Many of these studies or recommendations are oriented toward children. Chess, for example, is held up as a way to improve children’s focus and concentration, to strengthen their problem-solving skills, to bolster their creative thinking. But I’ve become convinced that whenever something is touted as being good for children, it’s even better for adults, in part because we assume we no longer need all those benefits an activity is said to provide. And yet what better remedy for the widespread affliction of “smartphone addiction” than two hours of burning your eyes and brain into 64 squares on a board, trying to analyse an almost infinite variety of moves and countermoves? Learning new skills also changes the way you think, or the way you see the world. Learning to sing changes the way you listen to music, while learning to draw is a striking tutorial on the human visual system. Learning to weld is a crash course in physics and metallurgy. You learn to surf and suddenly you find yourself interested in tide tables and storm systems and the hydrodynamics of waves. Your world got bigger because you did. Last, if humans seem to crave novelty, and novelty helps us learn, one thing that learning does is equip us with how to better handle future novelty. “More than any other animal, we human beings depend on our ability to learn,” the psychologist Alison Gopnik has observed. “Our large brain and powerful learning abilities evolved, most of all, to deal with change.” We’re always flipping between small moments of incompetence and mastery. Sometimes, we cautiously try to work out how we’re going to do something new. Sometimes, we read a book or look for an instructional video. Sometimes, we just have to plunge in.  • Beginners: The Curious Power of Lifelong Learning by Tom Vanderbilt is published by Atlantic and available at guardianbookshop.co.uk • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here",theguardian

  Chiesa imitates father in sinking Milan to drag Juve back into title race ","Did Federico Chiesa take some tips from his father before Juventus’s visit to Milan? Enrico scored goals everywhere he went in his career, but lining up against the Rossoneri always seemed to draw out something extra: the red-and-black flag to his bull. He punctured them 17 times in 24 encounters across Serie A and the Coppa Italia, more than he managed against any other club. Not bad when you consider the names of some of the defenders sent against him: Baresi, Costacurta, Maldini, Nesta and Stam. The back four that started for Milan on Wednesday was not quite in that category. Alessio Romagnoli and Simon Kjaer have formed an encouraging partnership at centre-back, but a feeling persists that the Italian has not yet realised his full potential, while his partner’s lack of pace can be exposed. On the right side of defence, Diogo Dalot made only his third Serie A start. Theo Hernández, one of Milan’s best signings in years, still has a way to go before being considered in such illustrious company. And this would turn out to be one of the left-back’s worst games for some time. There were not 20 minutes played when Chiesa left Hernández in his wake for the first time, shimmying in from the right-hand touchline, cutting the ball square for Paulo Dybala and accelerating towards the penalty box. The ball came back to him via the Argentinian’s masterful heel-flick, and Chiesa buried it into the far corner. It was a breathtaking start to a game that would keep its audience gasping. Chiesa had already struck the woodwork, slamming a half-volley into the right-hand upright, after Wojciech Szczesny produced an important near-post stop to thwart Samu Castillejo at the other end. Brilliant from Juve! ⚫⚪Chiesa and Dybala combine magnificently and the winger scores the opener 🔥 pic.twitter.com/4kU2VQInqV The stakes were as high as they could be at such an early stage of a campaign. Milan, unbeaten in 28 league games, had an opportunity to move four points clear at the top following Inter’s defeat to Sampdoria earlier on Wednesday. More significant still, a win would have left Juventus – champions of the past nine Serie A seasons – 13 points adrift. Both teams were missing key players. Milan have been without Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ismaël Bennacer since mid-December, but a suspension to Sandro Tonali, coupled with positive Covid tests for Rade Krunic and Ante Rebic left them so short that manager Stefano Pioli was compelled to draft right-back Davide Calabria into central midfield. Juventus had to do without Álvaro Morata up front – the only player besides Cristiano Ronaldo in their squad who had scored more than twice in this league season. Both of their own starting full-backs, Alex Sandro and Juan Cuadrado, were out after testing positive for Covid as well. Neither side, though, seemed willing to let such setbacks discourage them from trying to play on the front foot. Opportunities came thick and fast throughout the first 45 minutes. It was a Bentancur backheel inside his own penalty box that set up that early chance for Castillejo, and Aaron Ramsey was every bit as careless with a pass across the face the area that went straight to Milan’s Jens Petter Hauge. The Rossoneri equalised in the 41st minute, Calabria placing a gorgeous first-time finish into the top corner from the edge of the box. A 1-1 scoreline was a fair reflection of the balance of play, but it was a surprise not to see VAR intervene after Hakan Calhanoglu had appeared to foul Adrien Rabiot at the start of the move. Chiesa, though, was not finished. One month earlier, after Juventus’s win over Dinamo Kyiv, a journalist had asked him whether there were any traits he would like to steal from his dad. Federico did not mention Milan, back then, but instead replied: “his ability to shoot off either foot. He had phenomenal co-ordination.” Perhaps he has inherited more than he knows. Having scored the opener with his right boot, Chiesa put Juventus back in front with the left, running straight at Hernández to put the defender off balance before picking out the bottom corner, giving Gianluigi Donnarumma no chance even from 20 yards out. Chiesa does it AGAIN! 😱The 23-year-old came off with what looked like a knock immediately after the goal, but what a performance he's put in! 🙌 pic.twitter.com/w1X9vEY9LL It was the turning point. Milan did not yield but, for the first time in almost a year, Pioli’s young and overachieving team had come up against a domestic opponent they simply did not have answers for. When Chiesa limped out of the game after scoring his second, Andrea Pirlo sent on Dejan Kulusevski – a €35m signing – to replace him. The second-half substitutions spoke to the realities of both teams. Juventus went on to introduce Weston McKennie, Arthur and Federico Bernardeschi from the bench. Milan had Pierre Kalulu, a 20-year-old centre-back, together with teenage academy graduates Daniel Maldini and Lorenzo Colombo. It was McKennie who made it 3-1 to Juventus, from a Kulsevski assist. A greater vindication of Juventus’s summer transfer strategy was hard to imagine. On a night where Cristiano Ronaldo failed to sparkle, three young players who arrived together this summer had taken over the most important game of the league season to date, dragging their team back into the title picture. Chiesa, though, was the greatest gamble. He was the last to arrive, this October, and there were many who considered his signing to be superfluous for a club that already seemed to have too many options to deploy in support of Ronaldo – from Kulusevski, Dybala, Bernardeschi and Ramsey through to the newly-returned Morata. Was it really necessary to add Chiesa – whose deal is structured as a loan with obligation to buy, but could eventually cost them €60m in transfer fees – on top? If he can continue as he has started in 2021, there will be no doubts. He had already scored, and sparkled, in the 4-1 rout of Udinese at the weekend, and on Wednesday Pirlo was specific in highlighting the different options Chiesa gives to the team as a player who could dominate one-on-ones in the final 30 metres of the pitch. The player himself preferred to deflect the praise, crediting the manager for encouraging him to attack the penalty box more, and his Juventus teammates for showing him new tricks. “At the end of training we get together with Cristiano [Ronaldo] and Paulo [Dybala],” he said. “The younger players – me and Kulusevski – watch them and try to steal something.” After all those years observing his father, he has grown into a most accomplished thief.",theguardian
42,42,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/07/mikel-arteta-expects-mesut-ozil-future-to-be-decided-in-next-few-days-arsenal,Football  Arteta expects Özil future to be decided in 'next few days' ,"Mesut Özil’s future will be decided in “the next few days”, according to Mikel Arteta, although the Arsenal manager admits he does not yet know how or when the saga around his exiled playmaker will end. There is little doubt Özil, whose contract expires in the summer, has played his final game for the club and all parties are keen to move on from a soured relationship that has cast an expensive shadow. Özil has been linked with Fenerbahce and DC United in this transfer window although his agent, Erkut Sogut, said on Wednesday that the player’s “priority is to stay” until the end of the season. “I’m saying we will decide what’s happening in the next few days,” Arteta said when asked whether Özil could remain at the club. “I don’t know what is going to happen. Obviously now he’s free to negotiate with other clubs. We will discuss internally what the best solution for him is for the near future, obviously with the player and agent too, and try to find the best solution for everyone.” The logistics around Özil departing this month are likely to be complicated given none of his suitors would be able to match his £350,000 weekly wage. A simpler option might be for the former Germany international to commit to moving after his deal ends, but that would mean Arsenal have to retain a player omitted from Arteta’s Premier League and Europa League squads in October. “If something was sorted this month, it’s because it is good for both parties, it is good for Mesut and his future, and it’s good for the club,” Arteta said. “If that’s the case, we will move forward. If it’s not the case, the player will stay here.” Regarding Özil’s ostracising, which in theory could be reversed this month, Arteta said: “We have to make a decision. I had to make a decision and I made it. I knew the consequences of it and now we’re going to have to make another one in January.” Özil is available for Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie with Newcastle, although his involvement seems unthinkable. Thomas Partey could return from the thigh injury that has kept him out for all bar 45 minutes of the past two months’ action, although Arteta suggested he could be kept fresh for the Premier League meeting with Crystal Palace on Thursday. Whereas Özil’s fate is a relatively short-term issue for Arteta, the manager is increasingly anxious about the prospects of Folarin Balogun, a highly rated striker, committing his future to Arsenal. Balogun’s deal is up in July and a number of clubs are understood to be making inquiries about taking him on. Arteta suggested any stumbling block lay at the feet of the player’s representatives. “You need three parties to make a deal,” he said. “For sure, the club wants to make a deal, the manager wants to make a deal, the player wants to stay and I’m not sure about the agent.” Balogun shares a representative with several of Arsenal’s other young players, as well as the Borussia Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho. Arteta subsequently rowed back slightly on his assertion but the implication was clear. “No, I’m not saying he’s stopping [anything],” he said. “I’m saying we need to find an agreement with him. We are negotiating with an agent, with a player that wants to stay at the club and we need to find an agreement. “We are doing everything we can to keep him here and hopefully they are doing the same and they defend the same interests, which is the players’ interest, which is to stay at the football club and be successful with us.”",theguardian

  City purring again after stumbling upon winning formula ","Football feels at times almost wilfully contrarian, as though it delights in confounding those who try to plot a rational course through it. You can plan and plan and plan. You can have a manager who is famous for his attention to detail. You can study all the data, watch all the videos, think and plot and cogitate, formulate your grand strategy, then it turns out the answer all along was John Stones. Manchester City needed a right-sided central defender, everybody said. They had Aymeric Laporte, who was probably alongside Virgil van Dijk the best central defender in the league, but he prefers the left side, so City’s job in the summer was to find somebody to play alongside him. In that area, it was widely agreed, their recruitment had gone a little awry. They signed Nathan Aké from Bournemouth for £41m, the first senior central defender City had signed since Laporte in January 2018. But one who plays on the left. A squad player, then: cover, back-up for Laporte. Aké played in the first two games of the season, in the second of which City let in five against Leicester. He has started only three league games since, and given the last two of those were against West Brom and Newcastle United, two of the five lowest-scoring sides in the division, it’s fair to say his role is to be used against less threatening opponents to rest the frontline. But then City pounced. Rúben Dias, for £61.5m plus Nicolás Otamendi. A right-sided central defender, the first senior player City had bought in that position since Stones in August 2016. This, then, was the future: Dias and Laporte, the rock on which Pep Guardiola’s new cathedral would be built. And Dias has excelled this season. Few central defenders have adapted quite so unobtrusively into the Premier League, with all its long diags and elbows and second balls. His unruffled authority, the galvanising effect he has had, has drawn comparison to Van Dijk, which may be premature but is not unreasonable. The difference between City now and the porousness of the Leicester game is profound. But he hasn’t done it on the right of central defensive pairing; he’s done it on the left and alongside him is Stones. The solution, it turns out, was there all along. Stones is one of those unfortunate players who has become a cipher for a wider debate. It’s never just about him or his form: conversations always end up in debates about the nature of defending and how central defenders should behave. As soon as Everton signed him from Barnsley, he became the icon of a new age: an angular, slightly gawky figure more notable for his reading of the game and his passing than for the more traditional defensive arts of heading, tackling and marking. It’s a concept with which English football has never been entirely comfortable. Stones made errors, as all young defenders will, as all defenders will, particular those asked to play in the proactive way he is, and each one felt like a blow on the whole concept of defending he represents. The nadir perhaps came in England’s defeat against the Netherlands in the Nations League semi-final in 2019. However many mistakes could be tolerated for the benefits brought by his willingness to pass out from the back, this was too many. Form and confidence disintegrated. Last season he started only 12 league games. He played only one of the first nine this season. At 26, he felt like yesterday’s man. But then he came into the team against Burnley at the end of November. Since then, when he has been on the pitch, the only goal City have conceded is Callum Hudson-Odoi’s largely inconsequential late strike for Chelsea on Sunday. Against Manchester United on Wednesday, the Stones-Dias partnership was exceptional again, and Stones’s goal a welcome bonus. United didn’t play badly in a high-quality game, but the threat they offered was restricted largely to a couple of long-range efforts, a handful of set plays and some extremely optimistic appeals for penalties. Fernandinho was superb, not only in his goal, but in the way he protected the space in front of Stones and Dias, stifling Bruno Fernandes. City this season have been scratchy. They’ve lacked their usual flow. When they drew at home with West Brom, it seemed reasonable to wonder whether this might be the worst side of which Guardiola had ever been in charge. But against Chelsea and then again on Wednesday, there was a zip to their football. In 12 games since the defeat at Tottenham, they’ve conceded only three times. The question was how well the new partnership would stand up against a strong counterattacking side. Here, perhaps, was the beginning of an answer. United beat City three times last season, each time by sitting deep and playing on the break. In the league meeting last month, Guardiola was so concerned by United’s counter he had his side sit off and essentially accept a 0-0. There was no such caution on Wednesday. City in spells looked back to their fluent best, and that is part down to the sense of security the defence gives them. In Stones’s resurgence, perhaps, there is a reminder that players are not mere bundles of attributes and statistics. They have lives beyond the pitch. Form and confidence can fluctuate. A few bad games, a few bad months, shouldn’t mean a player is written off for ever. They are human and therefore unpredictable. Planning can only ever go so far. This may be a formula that has been stumbled upon, but City are starting to look hugely impressive.",theguardian

The manner in which Wasps defeated Exeter in a repeat of last October’s Premiership final was impressive. The Chiefs were below full strength – although not as much as they were at Ashton Gate last August when they showed Bristol how far they had to go – but such was the systematic way they were picked apart, it influenced the margin rather than the outcome. The following day, Leicester were locked in another struggle, this time at home to Bath. George Ford, who returned to Welford Road after the West Country club had sacked his father Mike as head coach, took it out on his former employers by employing a high kick with a difference. The Bath full-back Anthony Watson has seen many a Ford kick as an England colleague as well as a club opponent, but the spirals the fly-half sent into the air were precisely measured and had the maximum impact, fading as Watson went to catch the ball and making a knock-on more likely than a catch. The first thought was that if it caught on, it would lead to an increase in kicking at a time when there is a surfeit of it in the professional game, but it is not designed to result in a bout of kick tennis. It is an attacking option which usually gained Leicester possession as well as territory and left Watson wondering where to position himself. Fly-halves used to employ the spiral kick to find touch, but its tendency to fade on its downward path contained an element of risk that kicking coaches in the professional age snuffed out by employing a technique from Aussie Rules in which distance is traded in for accuracy. The spiral bomb has taken a long time to emerge from the laboratory, and it carries the danger of sliding off the side of the kicker’s boot and leaving their team exposed defensively, but Ford turned it into a long form of the kick-pass. The pity is Ford will have little time to develop it before the Six Nations. Leicester are not playing this weekend while their next scheduled match, against Bayonne in the European Challenge Cup, is in doubt after the Top 14 club unilaterally pulled out of the tournament after a number of positive Covid-19 tests. They may be ordered to reconsider, but with the Tigers having their own virus problems in recent weeks, will any of their number be comfortable travelling there? Wasps are due in Montpellier next week, armed with four successive victories after an uncertain start to the season when they were well beaten at Gloucester and lost at home to Newcastle. It is 11 months since Blackett became head coach, at first in an interim capacity, after the departure of the long-serving director of rugby Dai Young. His appointment appeared to be based on finance rather than ambition. The heady days after 2014, when Wasps abandoned High Wycombe for Coventry and signed players like Willie le Roux and Kurtley Beale to complement Danny Cipriani, Elliot Daly, Jimmy Gopperth and Christian Wade, had long faded. The club had pressing concerns before the pandemic and the squad had lost much of its glitter: only six of the side that started the 2017 Premiership final against Exeter were around for the return three years later. It has proved an inspired choice. Shortly after he was appointed full time, Blackett stated he did not want anyone, players or coaches, to change. “I want them to be who they are,” he said. “We were in a hole, but the players had the belief that we could turn it around.” Wasps have won 17 of the 21 matches Blackett has taken charge of. His player management has been exceptional: before he took over, having been attack coach since 2015, they had been one of the Premiership’s more adventurous sides but they had become increasingly brittle. He looked to add rather than take away and the manner in which they took on Exeter, at the strongest points of the Chiefs – scrum, lineout, maul and gainline – while still moving the ball when it was on showed what he had developed in a short time. He is the second youngest coach in the Premiership and has yet to be touted as a contender to succeed Eddie Jones with England, but that looks a matter of time given the way he is proving himself as a selector and a tactician: Wasps have become multidimensional. He chose the second-row James Gaskell in the back row against Exeter rather than the turnover specialist Thomas Young. It was a selection tailored for the opposition which had a telling impact on the game, and not because Gaskell scored two tries. He gave Wasps added height in the lineout against a side that kicks penalties into touch, rather than at goal, and he helped counter the Chiefs’ rolling maul. The week before, at Sale, Blackett had rested his England contingent and fielded young half-backs, Charlie Atkinson and Will Porter. Atkinson scored an individual try which brought to mind a young Cipriani while Porter resembled Dan Robson in his speed of thought and action. Blackett is not afraid to promote academy players and Alfie Barbeary was making headlines until an ankle injury forced him out until February or March. Saracens may not be around, but Exeter will not have it their own way this season. On Friday night Wasps are at Bath, whose forwards failed to deliver at Leicester, and in Blackett they are meeting someone who is not taking a spiral staircase to the top. • This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

45,50,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/07/london-population-decline-first-time-since-1988-report-covid-home-working,London  Population set to decline for first time since 1988 – report ,"London’s population is set to decline for the first time in more than 30 years, driven by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and people reassessing where they live during the crisis, according to a report. The accountancy firm PwC said the number of people living in the capital could fall by more than 300,000 this year, from a record level of about 9 million in 2020, to as low as 8.7 million. This would end decades of growth with the first annual drop since 1988. The forecast comes as city-dwellers rethink their living situations during lockdown and a boom in home working during the pandemic encourages growing numbers of people to consider moving elsewhere. Other drivers include a smaller number of graduates moving to London, fewer job opportunities in the capital and lower international migration to the city as a result of the pandemic and Brexit. Net EU migration to the UK as a whole has fallen since the 2016 Brexit vote, and could turn negative in 2021 – meaning more people leave the UK for the EU than arrive from it – for the first time since the early 1990s, according to PwC forecasts. The accountancy firm also said the UK could record a “baby bust” in 2021, with the annual birth rate dipping to the lowest level since records began more than a century ago. Although it will take time before official population figures are published, PwC said there were early signs that London was on track to shrink for the first time this century. It said an August 2020 survey by the London Assembly found that 4.5% of Londoners – or 416,000 people – said they would definitely move out of the city within the next 12 months. Official figures show UK unemployment is rising fastest in London boroughs, as the country grapples with the deepest recession for 300 years. Job postings have fallen by the most among Europe’s biggest capital cities. According to economists, London’s jobs woes are a reflection of the city’s density and typical opportunities for work during normal times – such as in hospitality, leisure, retail and travel – which have been hit hardest by the pandemic. Londoners are also more likely to work from home than anywhere else in the UK – due to a higher proportion of professional, IT and finance jobs in the City – meaning more people could move to other parts of the country if remote-working practices are sustained beyond the crisis. A decline in London’s population would represent a return to the years in the middle of the 20th century when London’s population collapsed after the second world war, as people moved away from the bombed-out and blitzed city for a life in the leafier home counties or other parts of the country, dropping from 8.6 million in 1939 to 6.8 million in the 1980s. Population growth returned in the late 1980s, fuelled by London’s growth as a global financial centre, epitomised by the redevelopment of Canary Wharf in the London Docklands. In a reversal of the mid 20th-century trend, international migration helped lift the population to its pre-war peak by 2015, and was on track to hit 10 million. Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said a sustained decline in London’s population would have wide-ranging consequences for the capital’s economy, house prices and transport network, but that it was too early to know for certain whether Covid and Brexit would have a long-term impact. “It depends on the extent to which remote working truly does become the new normal into the long term. A lot of people really miss the office environment, so once social distancing measures are fully history, infive to 10 years’ time, maybe people will go back more to city living,” she said. A spokesman for Sadiq Khan said the Mayor of London was confident that the city would emerge stronger from the Covid crisis. “The pandemic has had a profound effect on London and Londoners, but Sadiq is determined that the capital will recover to become cleaner, greener and fairer, with thriving neighbourhoods, improved wellbeing and a strengthened healthcare system.”",theguardian
46,58,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/06/northern-ireland-facing-food-supply-disruption-over-brexit-mps-told,"Brexit  Northern Ireland facing food supply disruption, MPs told ","Northern Ireland is facing disruptions to its food supply because suppliers in Great Britain are unaware of the Brexit-related paperwork needed to send goods to the region, business leaders have said. Trucks are arriving at GB ports with incorrect or absent documentation that delays their passage across the Irish Sea, they told MPs on Wednesday. Many operators in Great Britain seemed unaware that since 11pm on New Year’s Eve Northern Ireland was applying EU customs rules at its ports, meaning goods crossing the Irish Sea from other parts of the UK were subject to customs checks, Seamus Leheny, of the freight trade body Logistics UK, told the Northern Ireland affairs committee. “We had lorries arriving into Belfast with no documentation at all … it’s the lack of preparation on the GB side.” One large manufacturer had 15 lorries of food bound for Northern Ireland stuck because they lacked customs declarations, said Leheny. He cited another company that sent 285 lorries to Great Britain but only 100 returned, leading to knock-on disruption of supply chains. Another company resolved documentation problems after studying a YouTube tutorial. Leheny said ports and customs officials were working hard and flexibly to minimise disruption but he urged the government to improve communication so that hauliers were not left figuring out paperwork on their own. Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, told MPs that authorities in Belfast and London needed to be “shouting from the rooftops” so that suppliers and parcel companies understood the new rules. “This is a very turbulent time where decisions need to be taken at speed,” he said. Sainsbury’s has been forced to fill some of its Northern Ireland supermarket shelves with Spar-branded products. Shoppers at Tesco and other chains have reported bare shelves in some sections, especially chilled food. England, Scotland and Wales left the European Union’s single market for goods on 31 December but Northern Ireland did not. Products containing animal parts require export health certificates in accordance with EU regulations. Ian Paisley, an MP with the Democratic Unionist party, said the special arrangements for the region had been a “disaster” and justified ditching the Northern Ireland protocol, which had cleared the way for the final Brexit deal between London and Brussels. Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, told BBC Radio Ulster that companies were adapting to changes. “I think people will see, as things settle down, that things will flow as they did in 2020.”",theguardian
47,59,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/jon-ossoff-wins-georgia-runoff-election-democrats-senate,"Georgia election  Jon Ossoff wins runoff, giving Democrats control of Senate ","The Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff has won his Senate runoff election, giving Democrats control of the Senate for the opening of Joe Biden’s presidency. Ossoff’s victory against David Perdue, was called by the Associated Press late on Wednesday, and follows fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock’s victory against incumbent Kelly Loeffler. With the victories of Ossoff and Warnock, the US Senate is now 50-50. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the tie-breaking 51st vote, giving Democrats control of the chamber for the first time since 2015. A pastor who spent the past 15 years leading the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr preached, Warnock’s victory makes him the first Black senator in his state’s history. The results were a stinging rebuke of Donald Trump, who made one of his final trips in office to Georgia to rally his loyal base behind the state’s Republican candidates. In an emotional address early on Wednesday, Warnock vowed to work for all Georgians whether they voted for him or not, citing his personal experience with the American dream. His mother, he said, used to pick “somebody else’s cotton” as a teenager. “The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,” he said. “Tonight, we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible.” The Democrats were propelled to victory in Senate runoff elections by Black voters, young voters and new arrivals to the rapidly diversifying state, a coalition just strong enough to topple a long-dominant GOP and take control of the US Senate. Black voters cast 32% of the ballots, a slight increase from the presidential election two months ago, according to AP VoteCast. As in November, almost all – 94% – of those votes went for Democrats. Black voters accounted for about 60% of ballots for Democrats, according to the survey of 3,700 voters in the runoff elections. Voters under the age of 45 also broke for Democrats, as did suburban voters, women, low-income voters and voters who have lived in the state fewer than five years, a group that cast about 60% of their votes for Democrats. The coalition closely mirrored the one that handed Georgia’s electoral college votes to President-elect Joe Biden, the first Democrat to win the state since 1992. In defeating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, Democrats will have half the seats in the chamber, leaving Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris to serve as tie-breaker. The high-stakes runoffs drew hundreds of millions of dollars, media attention and a massive organizing effort. The result was a game of inches – both Republicans and Democrats largely held their voters from November, the survey showed, but Democrats did just slightly better in pushing their voters to the polls. The GOP candidates won an overwhelming majority – almost three-quarters – of white voters and 60% of voters 65 and older. They also captured majorities from voters earning $75,000 or more. That coalition in the recent past likely would have been enough to keep Perdue and Loeffler in the Senate. But shifting demographics and an energized Democratic party have turned the tables.",theguardian
48,61,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/07/minke-whale-trapped-in-nets-in-japan-for-two-weeks,Japan  Minke whale left trapped in nets for two weeks ,"Animal rights campaigners have demanded the immediate release of a minke whale that has been trapped for more than two weeks in nets in Taiji, a town on Japan’s Pacific coast known for its annul dolphin cull. Japanese media reported that attempts were being made to free the four or five metre long whale but fishermen claimed its size and strong tidal currents were making it difficult to guide it into open water. Ren Yabuki – an animal rights activist who has been filming the whale with a drone every day since it became trapped on Christmas Eve – said fishermen had made only one brief attempt to release the animal, adding that its fate appeared to have been decided. “It is difficult to guide the whale out of the nets and they don’t want to remove the nets as that would disrupt fishing and allow a large number of fish to escape, so my feeling is that they are going to kill it,” said Yabuki, campaign director of the Life Investigation Agency. If they slaughter the whale, fishermen would be able to sell its meat after taking a DNA sample, Yabuki added. “Allowing the whale to starve to death would be the worst possible end to this, so the only other option would be to draw in the net and send divers into the sea to kill it with spears.” Georgie Dolphin, animal welfare programme manager at Humane Society International [HSI] in Australia, said the whale had become “increasingly distressed and agitated, ramming the nets and deep diving in an effort to escape”. “We fear time is now running out for the whale who will be getting weaker by the day. Intentionally subjecting these leviathans to prolonged suffering is inhumane and unjustified. HSI is hoping the Japanese authorities will insist on the immediate release of the whale.” The Japanese fisheries agency told HSI that it had asked the prefectural government to release the whale if it was possible and safe to do so. “We gather the fishermen are claiming safety issues and concern over the tides but we fear the delays could cost the whale its life,” HSI said. Taiji has struggled to repair its international reputation since the 2009 Oscar-winning documentary The Cove showed hunters rounding up dolphins in the open sea and corralling them to the coastline in so-called drive hunts. Attractive specimens are spared and sold for large sums to aquariums and marine parks, while others are killed and their meat sold. The hunts attracted international condemnation, including from the former US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy. In a rare interview, fishermen told the Guardian that the hunts were legal under Japanese law and provided a vital source of income for the town, located on a remote part of the Pacific coastline. Yabuki said failure to save it would further damage Taiji’s reputation. “The whole world knows what is happening,” he said. “Letting it die, or killing it, would ruin the town’s image. But if they make a genuine attempt to release it, they can tell the world that they did the right thing.”",theguardian
49,63,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/06/doj-email-systems-solarwinds-hackers,US  Justice department confirms email accounts breached by SolarWinds hackers ,"The US Department of Justice confirmed on Wednesday that its email systems had been accessed by the hackers who broke into the software company SolarWinds, another indication of the gravity of the breach that has shaken Washington. The scale of the hack at the justice department was not immediately clear but it could be significant. The department, which has more than 100,000 employees across a series of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the US Marshals Service, said in a statement that 3% of its Office 365 mailboxes were potentially accessed. The statement went on to say that the justice department had no indication that any classified systems were affected. But winning access to as many as thousands of email inboxes from the nation’s premier law enforcement organization could still provide an intelligence bonanza for foreign hackers. The department plays a key role in rooting out foreign spies, enforcing sanctions and fighting corruption. The department has recently taken increasingly aggressive actions against foreign hackers, unsealing a series of indictments against Russian, Chinese and Iranian cyber spies in the run-up to the US presidential election two months ago. A justice spokesman, Marc Raimondi, declined to put a precise figure to the number of mailboxes targeted. The statement said the justice department’s office of the chief information officer discovered the breach on the day before Christmas, weeks after the first reports emerged that hackers suspected of acting on Russia’s behalf had broken into US government networks. Russia has denied responsibility for the hacking campaign, which has been described as one of the most sophisticated operations uncovered in years. But on Tuesday, the office of the US director of national intelligence said Russia was probably behind the hack in the first formal statement of attribution from the Trump administration. The hackers were able to gain access to a swath of government agencies by tampering with network monitoring software sold by the Austin-based SolarWinds. In a joint statement, the national intelligence office, the FBI, the National Security Agency, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency inside the Department of Homeland Security said the actor, “likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks”. The investigation is continuing, they said, and could turn up additional government victims. As of now the hackers’ goal appeared to be collecting intelligence, rather than any destructive acts. Fewer than 10 government agencies were affected, the director of national intelligence said, but did not specify how many. Cybersecurity experts have said a full recovery from the breaches could take months – or even longer.",theguardian
50,68,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/07/making-waves-the-hit-indian-island-radio-station-leading-climate-conversations,Making waves  The hit Indian island radio station leading climate conversations ,"Selvarani Mari is a fisher and seaweed collector who lives on Pamban Island of Tamil Nadu, on the southernmost tip of India. Every day she helps her husband cast the fishing nets, maintains rafts for cultivating seaweed, and dives into the ocean to gather sargassum. But she always makes time to listen to the radio. Mari, 33, and her friends and family all unfailingly tune into Kadal Osai on 90.4FM, India’s first local radio station for a fishing community. With guests including from older people from the villages sharing their fishing wisdom or chatting about the climate crisis, the station has become an integral part of local life, featuring gossip, jokes, old songs and news on fish prices and sea conditions. Gayathri Usman, head of Kadal Osai, fell in love with the station when she visited the area, and stayed on to run it. “While a majority of the 12-member crew is from the same community, I am the odd one out,” she says. “Our shows are popular because they are entertaining, useful, and, more importantly, in a local dialect of Tamil that the fishing community understands and finds comfort in,” she says. Started by businessman Armstrong Fernando, himself from a fishing family, Kadal Osai (“the sound of the ocean” in Tamil) began in August 2016 with just a few hours of transmission daily, before going full-time in 2019. Alongside updates on weather, marine affairs and fish prices, advice on safe and sustainable fishing and the preservation of coral reefs, the station also conducts on and off-air workshops on the climate crisis and biodiversity. On the fringes of India’s mainland, across the water from Sri Lanka, Pamban and the surrounding 20 islands and coral reefs are part of the richly biodiverse Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, and home to 47 hamlets of the indigenous Marakeyars, engaged in fishing for centuries. “Due to poor signal reception, the fishing community cannot solely depend on the All India Radio [India’s national broadcaster], especially while at sea. In such a scenario, it is Kadal Osai – with a coverage area of 5-10km – that they tune into,” says Usman. In the past few years, the climate crisis has had a drastic effect on marine life and local livelihoods. Senthil Rajan is a microbiologist at a seaweed cultivation site in Pamban. “It has become increasingly difficult to predict and interpret water levels in the ocean, cyclone formations, and potential fishing zones. The erratic weather patterns have led to an unprecedented rise in sea levels as well as the height of the waves, thus affecting many seaweed cultivating sites,” says Rajan. “In such a scenario, tapping into the traditional knowledge of the fishing community, remains a rich source of learning.” Understanding this need to share knowledge with the next generation, Kadal Osai invites experienced fishers to talk with experts about the effects of over-exploitation on marine resources, and the importance of integrating traditional and modern fishing methods. “Using umbrella terms such as climate change and global warming with this coastal community may not drive home the point effectively. So, we juxtapose the knowledge passed down the generations with the right mix of anecdotes and scientific techniques and keep the dialogue going on climate change,” says Usman.  We keep the dialogue going on climate change Radio is one of the most powerful methods of communication in India, with enormous reach among its 1.38bn population. Even prime minister Narendra Modi has a monthly programme.  Unicef collaborated with 215 community radio stations in India, such as Kadal Osai, to create awareness around ending child marriage, something which has been on the decline in India, by 2030. “We started the ‘Kutty Chutty Express’ to inform children on the ill-effects of child marriages through skits, quizzes and roadshows, as well as conducting workshops,” says Usman. The station also publicises the number for Childline India Foundation, which operates the country’s first 24-hour hotline for children in distress. During the pandemic, Kadal Osai has become a bridge between the authorities and the coastal communities. It created awareness of the importance of sanitising and social distancing, and also distributed free masks. “In the initial months, we tried to break a myth among islanders – who believed that they were safe from Covid-19, being surrounded by the salty sea water. Now, since the lockdown has been relaxed, we highlight that ostracising affected people isn’t the solution,” says Usman, as she signs off to go live on 90.4FM, and continue her mission to entertain and inform her faithful community of listeners.

51,69,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/05/trump-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-lease-sales,US  Trump auctions Arctic refuge to oil drillers in last strike against US wilderness ,"In one of its last strikes against the American wilderness, Donald Trump’s administration will on Wednesday auction off portions of the Arctic national wildlife refuge to oil drillers. The lease sales are the climax to one of the nation’s highest-profile environmental battles. The lands on the northern coastal plain of Alaska are home to denning polar bears and migrating herds of Porcupine caribou that indigenous communities depend on and consider sacred. But the oil industry has long suspected that the ground beneath the plain holds billions of barrels of petroleum. Once the leases in the refuge, known as ANWR, are sold to energy companies, they would be difficult to claw back. The incoming president, Joe Biden, could, however, discourage development in the refuge by putting regulatory hurdles in the way of drillers.   The refuge has become central to America’s debate over how quickly to stop drilling for and burning fossil fuels as the climate crisis accelerates. Climate experts say there should be no new oil and gas extraction, as the world is already more than 1C hotter than pre-industrial times. Even if humans stopped using fossil fuels today, the planet would continue to heat. Oil from drilling west of the refuge, at Prudhoe Bay, has fueled the economic development the state has depended on to fill its coffers and write annual revenue checks to residents. That extraction also led to the most damaging oil spill in history, when the Exxon Valdez tanker spewed millions of barrels off Alaska’s southern coast in 1989. Prudhoe Bay “was the largest oil field ever discovered in North America. Since then we have had more than 1,500 sq miles of oil and gas development in the Alaskan Arctic … but [ANWR] has been off limits,” said Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League. “For us, it symbolizes just what’s at stake here. If you can’t draw a line at the tundra and keep this one area of the Arctic off limits, then the question is, where can you draw the line and what protected part or wildlife refuge in the United States will remain off limits?” President Dwight Eisenhower designated the Arctic refuge in 1960, and in the ensuing decades, the industry and Republicans pushed for drilling there, while the US was trying to reduce its reliance on suppliers in the Middle East. That push continues even though oil is now plentiful, and a fracking boom has made the US a net exporter rather than importer. Republicans in the US Congress and in Alaska achieved their goal in 2017, when they inserted a provision authorizing drilling into Trump’s landmark tax bill. Trump and congressional Republicans argued that the government’s earnings from drilling in the refuge could help pay for the proposed tax cuts, which favored corporations and wealthier Americans. They said development would generate $900m, although an analysis by the non-partisan watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, based on historical bid data, found that it would bring in just a fraction of that amount – no more than $27.6m. That would be split between the federal government and the state of Alaska. “The fact that this was being offered as an offset was definitely insincere at best, and we thought that was just kind of a joke,” said Autumn Hanna, vice-president of the group.  Taxpayers for Common Sense has argued the government should not be leasing any public land to oil and gas drilling now, while prices for the commodities are low and supplies are high worldwide. During the pandemic, oil demand has plunged as businesses have been shut down and people have driven less. “We’re not opposed to oil and gas drilling, but we’re opposed to short-changing taxpayers,” Hanna said. Industry interest in developing new oilfields is so low that some have suggested there might not be any bids for some tracts of land on the coastal plain. The former governors Frank Murkowski and Bill Walker have encouraged the state to bid on any unwanted tracts itself, and last week a state-owned economic development corporation voted to authorize bidding up to $20m.  “If there are no bidders on the lease sales at all, Alaska will likely never be able to develop our oil and gas potential from ANWR,” Murkowski said in an opinion piece in the Anchorage Daily News, where he also noted the oil and gas industry had historically contributed 70% of the state’s revenue. On Monday, the Trump administration also dramatically expanded the area where the government can lease public land for oil drilling to the west of ANWR. The plan would allow drilling in 82% of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, an area bigger than the state of West Virginia, according to environmental groups, though the Biden administration could reverse that decision more easily than it could hold off drilling in ANWR. Native groups in Alaska have fought ANWR drilling proposals with lawsuits. For the Gwich’in, indigenous Alaskans who have migrated alongside the caribou and relied upon them as a food source, the fight is personal. They formed the Gwich’in Steering Committee in 1988 to oppose drilling in the coastal plain, which they call the Sacred Place Where Life Begins. “We come from some of the strongest people that ever walked this earth. They survived some of the coldest, harshest winters so that we can be here,” Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the committee, said during an AM radio segment last week. “I feel like this is my responsibility as a Gwich’in, to protect the caribou.” Polar bear advocates say the habitat is also critical to a population in dire straits from development and rising temperatures that are melting sea ice. The Arctic is heating at a much faster pace than the rest of the world. Polar bear numbers in Alaska and western Canada declined 40% from 2001 to 2010, said Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for Polar Bears International. “If we want to have the best chance possible of maintaining that population until the time that we stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, we need to protect them on the ground as best we can,” Amstrup said. Ken Whitten, a former caribou biologist for the state of Alaska, said drilling was likely to displace wildlife. “It’s the core of the Porcupine caribou herd calving area. It’s the major onshore denning place for polar bears in the Beaufort Sea, which is becoming more and more important as the sea ice disappears.” The plain is a narrow band of land between mountains and the coast, so animals do not have many options when they are forced to relocate, he said. Much of the surrounding area is already being drilled. “We are a wealthy nation,” Whitten said. “We can afford to leave some areas alone.”",theguardian

55,97,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jan/07/deaf-asl-interpreters-pandemic,US  Why Deaf interpreters are a crucial tool during the pandemic ,"Saamanta Serna describes herself as a Coda – the child of a Deaf adult. She grew up up with a Deaf mother and a father who is hearing and an American sign language (ASL) interpreter, and later decided to pursue interpreting herself after high school. Now a certified ASL interpreter, Serna has done frequent in-person interpreting for medical appointments during Covid. She has also noticed a change in the world’s perception of sign language since the beginning of the pandemic: more people are paying attention. Conveying updated information to everyone in the time of Covid is a matter of life or death, as the Trump administration learned recently after losing a groundbreaking federal lawsuit to the National Association for the Deaf, which ensured that a sign language interpreter must be present in Covid briefings and visible on the live feed from the White House. The Trump White House did not include its first sign language interpreter on a Covid briefing until 11 November, a full nine months after the pandemic reached America. ASL is a common sign language – though by far not the only one – for people who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing (deaf refers to the physical condition of deafness, while Deaf refers to belonging to the Deaf community). About 15% of adults in America report hearing loss, and about 1 million use sign language to communicate. ASL has its own rules and incorporates hand movements as well as facial motions, grammar and word ordering distinct from English, from which it is completely separate. Marla Berkowitz, a certified Deaf interpreter, explains that ASL “entails five parameters: handshapes, palm orientation, location (space on the body, around the signer), movement and of course, facial expressions”. Even within ASL there are wide variants, differences in rhythm or slang, even regional accents and dialects. Black American Sign Language (BASL), for example, is a dialect of ASL developed during segregation. Black d/Deaf Americans, denied deaf education, socialized language differently than white d/Deaf Americans, with unique hand positions and word formations. Nakia Smith, a 22-year-old who is the fourth deaf generation in her family, explained this recently in a video from Netflix. (Smith’s TikTok channel, which featured her and her grandpa signing and explaining BASL, recently went viral.) TikTok videos from d/Deaf creators like Smith (her TikTok username is itscharmay) and Diandra Hooper (theoriginaldeafbae) have helped bring sign language to the hearing masses. Instagram and Twitter are also full of accounts featuring video clips where people can learn a sign a day. Perhaps the interest in signing is due, in part, to pandemic mask-wearing. Masks muffle speech, making it more difficult to communicate using spoken language, even for those who are hearing. For those like me, who are hard of hearing and utilize lip reading, it’s virtually impossible. More people than ever are also being exposed to sign language through frequent Covid-related press conferences. Alongside governors and medical officers, in press briefings and media events, on television and online, sign language interpreters are working to pass on vital information. Translating spoken English to sign language requires interpreters like Berkowitz, who is also certified by the supreme court of Ohio and the Ohio department of education. She made national news with her work signing for Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine. Admirers made a Facebook fan page, and she even has her own bobblehead doll. I wish that people would normalize this communication access versus just making it a show Other interpreters who have gone viral recently include Nic Zapko, who works with the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz; David Cowan, known for interpreting Governor Brian Kemp’s press conferences in Georgia; and Arkady Belozovsky, who grabbed the world’s attention when he interpreted an intense exchange between the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and reporters. Viewers have been drawn to Berkowitz’s energy, animated manner and expressions. Facial expressions, as Berkowitz said, “are an equivalent to intonation, revealing feelings, thoughts and mood while simultaneously utilizing the grammar markers (eye-gazing, eyebrow raised/lowered …) to distinguish statements from questions”. It’s not simply dramatic effect, but essential to the language. “I wish that people would normalize this communication access versus just making it a show,” said Serna. I talked to Brian Cheslik, the artistic director for Deaf Austin Theatre and an interpreter for performances. Cheslik is also d/Deaf, as is Berkowitz, in a field where many interpreters are hearing.  “There is a stark difference in the interpretation style between Deaf and hearing interpreters,” Cheslik said. “Often, Deaf interpreters are native signers [since birth], so their signing style incorporates Deaf cultural norms, whereas hearing interpreters have a different style … as a Deaf person, I can always tell if an interpreter is Deaf or hearing.” Berkowitz described hearing interpreters as “second-language users. Deaf people are not an ethnic monolith and require interpreting training to be certified Deaf interpreters, yet to work as an interpreter, one has to be bilingual – ASL and English – as well as [to have] inherited cultural knowledge and nuances.” Both Cheslik and Berkowitz spoke to the importance of working together with hearing interpreters, especially when information may be impromptu or rapidly evolving. “I cherish my hearing interpreters on my team because they are always there to help me when I miss something, or if there is a change or announcement made,” Cheslik said, characterizing work with hearing interpreters as “a very important relationship”. Perhaps no recent situation has a more urgent need for clear information than Covid press conferences. These conferences relay ever-changing regulations, and provide essential medical advice on stopping the spread of the virus. “Interpreting during Covid is challenging in every way,” Berkowitz said, describing handling press conference jargon, teamwork with other interpreters who may have different styles, and “the tremendous responsibility with getting accurate information in ASL”. “The greatest joy is knowing the Deaf and hard of hearing community are receiving first-hand information seen on TV in ASL for the very first time in our lives,” Berkowitz said. “To have Deaf interpreters spotlighted and highlighted during events like Joe Biden’s press conferences has been so amazing,” says Serna. “Also the fact that that he is normalizing having an interpreter on camera.” All the interpreters interviewed for this story spoke to the struggle of getting sign language to be respected by the hearing population – a struggle I remember from my own studies, when I fought with my hearing professors who said ASL was not a “real” language, and would not count for my degree. “ASL is NOT broken English or even a form of English. ASL is an actual language with its own grammatical structure, and syntax that is embedded in Deaf culture,” Cheslik said. “Yes, ASL is beautiful, but it is our language.” ",theguardian

The extratropical storm saw its central pressure fall to a record 921 millibars from 972 millibars in 24 hours, making it the strongest storm in that basin in at least 60 years, and also setting records for Alaska and the Bering Sea in its path onwards. Meanwhile, a global record for the highest mean sea-level pressure was broken in Mongolia, central Asia, barely days before. A recording of 1094.3 millibars came hand-in-hand with bitingly low temperatures of -45.5C (-50F) in Tsetsen-Uul in the western Zavkha province. This year, on the other hand, opened with a disruptive ice storm across the midwest and Great Lakes of the US. Ice storms, or freezing rain, occur as raindrops falling vertically through the atmosphere move into a thin layer of sub-freezing air near the earth’s surface. This allows the droplets to become supercooled and freeze upon contact with any objects, creating extremely hazardous conditions such as ice coats the ground. In the southern hemisphere, the first storm of the season was birthed. Tropical Cyclone Imogen made landfall in the Shire of Carpentaria in Queensland, Australia, on Monday, with reports of over 260mm of rain falling in Karumba.",theguardian
57,108,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/facebook-twitter-youtube-trump-video-supporters-capitol,  Twitter and Facebook lock Donald Trump’s accounts after video address ,"Twitter and Facebook took unprecedented actions to address the spread of misinformation and the incitement of violence by Donald Trump on their platforms on Wednesday, after supporters of the president stormed the US Capitol. Both companies locked Trump’s accounts and removed several posts from the president that cast doubt on the election results and praised his supporters, who forcibly took to the government building as lawmakers attempted to tally votes for the election. Facebook has suspended Trump from posting to his account for 24 hours. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, also locked Trump’s account. Twitter locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours and is requiring him to delete three tweets the company says violates its policies. If he does not delete them, his account will remain suspended indefinitely, the company said in a public statement. If Trump again violates the policies, his account will be permanently suspended from Twitter. A statement from Trump promising an “orderly transition” following Congress certifying Biden’s win was posted to Twitter by deputy chief of staff for communications Dan Scavino. The action is the most aggressive yet from Twitter and it comes after it joined Facebook and YouTube in removing a video post from Trump’s account in which the president praised the protestors. Earlier on Wednesday, Twitter blocked several of Trump’s posts from being shared, citing a “risk of violence”. As his supporters gathered on Wednesday to protest the certification of the 3 November election results, Trump in a tweet accused Vice-president Mike Pence of lacking “the courage to do what should have been done”. In the video he shared on social media later in the day, Trump urged his supporters to “go home”, but also gave legitimacy to the falsehoods that fueled Wednesday’s attempted insurrection, calling the election “stolen” and telling the angry mob, “we love you”. Later on Wednesday, Trump again falsely claimed his “election victory” was “unceremoniously” and “viciously” stripped away. “In line with our civic integrity policy and recent guidance, we have placed a label on the tweet, and have significantly restricted engagement with the tweet due to the risk of violence,” a Twitter spokesman said. “This means this tweet will not be able to be replied to, retweeted, or liked.” Facebook took a number of measures throughout the day, including the unprecedented decision to remove a post made by the president. “This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video,” said Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice-president of integrity, in a tweet. “We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to, rather than diminishes, the risk of ongoing violence.” Facebook also said it would be removing content that praises the storming of the US capitol, calls to bring weapons to locations across the US, videos and photos from protestors at the Capitol, and any “attempts to restage violence” in the coming days. It has banned the hashtag #StormtheCapitol, which was used to organize Wednesday’s actions and designated it as “dangerous”, a category the platform usually reserves for hate groups and terrorists. Facebook has also increased rules for content moderation in private Facebook groups, where extremism experts have long warned many such militarized actions are planned. The platform is now increasing the requirement of Group administrators to review and approve posts before they can go up and disabling comments that have a high rate of hate speech. Still, dozens of “Stop the Steal” Facebook groups and events remain live on the site. Online activism group Color of Change launched a petition on Wednesday calling on social media firms to remove the president, saying they have ignored years of warnings about the dangers of white supremacists using these platforms to recruit, organize and fundraise. “Big tech companies are complicit in the insurrection in DC today,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change. “Enough is enough. It’s time for Facebook and Twitter to kick Trump off their platforms.” In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, D.C., we are working proactively to protect the health of the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rules. Twitter’s suspension of Trump’s account came after it faced intense pressure on Wednesday to suspend the president’s account as tensions in Washington rose. “Threats of and calls to violence are against the Twitter rules, and we are enforcing our policies accordingly,” Twitter said. The company’s safety account, which shares updates and enforcements of company policy, also said it is working to rein in violent language on the platform as the attempted coup continues to unfold. Twitter in the past has flagged several Trump tweets sharing misinformation or calling for violence. Most notably, the president’s May 2020 tweets encouraging violence against protesters demonstrating against police violence were hidden and prevented from being shared. But the company has also faced criticism for failing to remove tweets quickly enough and calls to remove the account entirely. Though Twitter doubled down on its enforcement of policies against misinformation and calls to violence in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, it was slower to take action in days and months following. On 11 November, the site took more than an hour to flag a highly misleading video shared by Trump. It was retweeted more than 70,000 times before the platform took action. Facebook has also faced criticism for its role in promoting misinformation and allowing armed groups to organize. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced intense criticism for the company’s decision to leave up the presidents’ message inciting violence against protesters demonstrating against police violence, as companies like Twitter removed them. Facebook also began to remove militias from its platform in 2020 August, months after it was found thousands of extremist groups were using the site to organize anti-Democratic, armed actions, a shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin organized on Facebook left two dead, and the violent kidnapping of Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer was planned on the platform. Surrounding the storming of the Capitol on Wednesday, Facebook was again targeted with blame as many of the events and protests that led to the action were organized there. “The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,” a Facebook spokesman said. “We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.”",theguardian
58,112,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-mob-capitol-clash-police-washington,  America shaken after pro-Trump mob storms US Capitol building ,"America was shaken on Wednesday as a mob of Donald Trump supporters staged an insurrection at the US Capitol building in Washington DC, storming the debating chambers and clashing with armed police. Four people died in the unrest that rocked the capital on Wednesday, Washington DC police said, including a woman who was shot dead by the US Capitol police. Three others died in “medical emergencies”, the DC police chief, Robert Contee, said. The siege was among the worst security breaches in American history and came after Trump had earlier urged a crowd of protesters to march on the Capitol and undo his November election defeat. The violence halted the tallying of electoral college votes to affirm Joe Biden’s victory, with Mike Pence, the vice-president, and members of Congress evacuated to undisclosed locations for their safety. DC police said the woman who was killed at the Capitol was shot as the mob tried to break through a barricaded door where police were armed on the other side. She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died. In a sombre televised address while the mob was still massed on the Capitol steps, Biden, the president-elect, condemned the mayhem. “This is not dissent,” he said. “It’s disorder, it’s chaos, it borders on sedition and it must end now.” The Capitol dome is known worldwide as a political symbol and the House of Representatives and Senate chambers are revered as almost sacred. But Wednesday’s carnage struck the latest and perhaps most savage blow to the America’s reputation as a paragon of liberal democracy. Thousands of rioters gathered on the Capitol steps wielding flags including “Make America great again”, “Liberty or death: don’t tread on me” and the pro-south confederacy. Some broke down barriers and barged through police lines to enter the building, chanting “USA! USA!”, smashing windows, wandering halls and corridors and occupying offices with impunity. One reached the Senate dais and yelled, “Trump won that election!” Protesters stormed the offices of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, knocking over tables and ripping photos off the walls. A photograph appeared to show one of them sitting contemptuously with his foot on Pelosi’s desk. One stunning picture showed security forces inside the House chamber pointing guns at protesters through a broken window as if under siege. Another captured protesters lying face down on the floor as police pointed weapons at them. DC police said pipe bombs had been recovered outside the offices of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee. Police also found a cooler with a long gun and Molotov cocktail in a vehicle on the Capitol grounds. Police made 52 arrests. Having lit the political fire, Trump made a belated plea for calm but repeated the lie that the election was rigged. “I know your pain, I know you’re hurt,” he said. “We had an election that was stolen from us. “But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order, we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt. We love you.” Trump’s repeated claims of election fraud forced unprecedented enforcement actions by social media companies. Twitter and Facebook locked Trump out of his accounts, and both platforms removed several posts from the president that cast doubt on the election results and praised his supporters. Biden struck a very different tone in his remarks. “At this hour, our democracy’s under unprecedented assault, unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times... The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent the true America, do not represent who we are. What we’re seeing are a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness.” He added: “I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the constitution and demand an end to this siege. It’s not protest. It’s insurrection.” Reinforcements were called in. The Washington DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, activated the national guard and issued a citywide curfew in from 6pm on Wednesday until 6am Thursday. Ralph Northam, the governor of neighbouring Virginia, announced that he would send members of the Virginia national guard and 200 state troopers. I call on President Trump to go on television now to demand an end to this siege. It’s not protest. It’s insurrection It was not until early evening, almost four hours after violent pro-Trump occupiers disrupted the electoral count, that officials declared the Capitol “secure”. The certification of electoral college votes resumed later Wednesday night. “Today, a shameful assault was made on our democracy,” said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. “It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden.” The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, called for the “goons” and “thugs” and “domestic terrorists” who stormed the Capitol to be “prosecuted to the full extent of the law”. “This mob was in good part President Trump’s doing, incited by his words and his lies,” Schumer said. Pence called on his colleagues to “get back to work”. “To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today: you did not win,” he said as the proceedings restarted. “Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people’s house.” Wednesday’s chaos provoked alarm and revulsion around the world. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, tweeted: “Shocking scenes in Washington DC. The outcome of this democratic election must be respected.” Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, called the scenes “disgraceful”, adding: “The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.” The carnage unfolded after Trump, due to leave office on 20 January, earlier in the day addressed thousands of protesters on a grassy expanse near the White House called the Ellipse, repeating false claims that the election was stolen from him due to widespread election fraud and irregularities. “We will never give up,” said Trump, who has spent years inciting anger and conspiracy theories. “We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.” Members of the House and Senate were then debating objections to the results by Trump’s allies. The president had pressures Pence to throw out election results in states he narrowly lost, but Pence publicly acknowledged that he has no such power. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, denounced the effort, warning: “If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.” But the mob forced an abrupt halt to proceedings. As rioters shouted while marching through the halls, people inside the chambers were directed to duck under their seats for cover and put on gas masks after tear gas was used in the Capitol rotunda. Fortunately a Senate aide remembered to take the electoral college documents with him as he evacuated the chamber. The building was locked down as law enforcement battled to regain control. Questions swirled over how the rioters were able to get so far with such little resistance in contrast to the heavy handed crackdown on peaceful Black Lives Matter marchers last summer. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator for Connecticut, said: “My staff and I are safe at a secure location. I am absolutely sickened by scenes of anarchist mobs violently swarming the Capitol. It’s not a protest – it’s armed insurrection. “This is an assault on the heart of our democracy incited and fueled by the President of the United States and his enablers. Make no mistake: Congress will do its job. This election will still be certified, and President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will be sworn in on January 20.” Former president George W Bush condemned what he called “insurrection”, saying in a statement: “This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic – not our democratic republic. I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement.”",theguardian
59,114,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/trump-adviser-resigns-two-other-senior-officials-consider-quitting-matt-pottinger,  Trump adviser resigns and two other senior officials consider quitting ,"Donald Trump’s deputy national security adviser, Matt Pottinger, has resigned, and two other senior White House officials – the national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, and the deputy chief of staff, Chris Liddell – are reportedly considering stepping down after a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building. Pottinger’s departure comes amid speculation that others will also quit after the US president incited and praised rioters while continuing to air baseless grievances over his loss of the presidency. So far six officials associated with Trump and his inner circle have said they are quitting, including members of Melania Trump’s team, after the deadly violence that surrounded the Congressional vote to certify Joe Biden’s presidential election victory in November. Senior Republican figures have also indicated splits from the president. Tweeting from his personal account, O’Brien – a staunch Trump loyalist – praised the behaviour of the vice-president, Mike Pence, who resisted Trump’s pressure to overturn the election certification, while making no mention of Trump. “I just spoke with Vice President Pence. He is a genuinely fine and decent man,” he tweeted. “He exhibited courage today as he did at the Capitol on 9/11 as a Congressman. I am proud to serve with him.” In further fallout that underlined the fracturing of the Trump administration’s inner circles, Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, indicated to journalists he had been banned from the White House by Trump after the president “blamed” him for advice he gave to Pence on Trump’s demands he overturn the election result. According to reports in the US media, some senior administration officials have also begun talking informally about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the president before his term expires on 20 January, while calls are also growing for a second impeachment to ensure Trump cannot run for public office again. In stark language that underlined the toxic and swirling sense of crisis, the Washington Post quoted one administration official describing Trump’s behaviour on Wednesday as that of “a monster,” while another said the situation was “insane” and “beyond the pale”. Two of the first lady’s top aides resigned on Wednesday night including Stephanie Grisham, a longtime Trump loyalist who previously served as White House press secretary. Anna Cristina Niceta, the White House social secretary, also resigned. The deputy White House press secretary, Sarah Matthews, also announced her resignation, saying she was “deeply disturbed” by the storming of the Capitol. “I was honoured to serve in the Trump administration and proud of the policies we enacted. As someone who worked in the halls of Congress I was deeply disturbed by what I saw today,” Matthews said in a statement. “I’ll be stepping down from my role, effective immediately. Our nation needs a peaceful transfer of power.” The sense of anger within a Republican party at war with itself was increasingly in full view. “[Trump] screwed his supporters, he screwed the country and now he’s screwed himself,” a 2016 Trump campaign official told Politico. The former New Jersey governor Chris Christie – who said he repeatedly tried to call Trump during the crisis – also laid the blame squarely at Trump’s feet. “The president caused this protest to occur,” Christie told ABC News. “He is the only one who can make it stop.”",theguardian

61,1,/market/stock-market-news/wall-street-s-big-banks-focus-on-small-deals-11601659625397.html,Wall Street’s big banks focus on small deals,"But with the pandemic-induced slowdown in dealmaking this year, bankers who have been talking about embracing smaller clients for ages are finally doing it. They’re swooping in on smaller transactions -- those of $500 million or less -- winning assignments to an extent not seen in five years. And in so doing, they are elbowing out some lesser rivals that typically make their bread and butter advising smaller clients. “When the larger deals are slow, people pick up the smaller deals,"" said David Friedland, global head of mergers and acquisitions in the cross-markets team at Goldman Sachs. In the first nine months of the year, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley advised on about $61 billion of announced transactions in the global small and midsize segment, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That gave them 9.2% of that market, their largest slice since 2015, and enough for the banks to dominate the advisory rankings. It’s a big change from last year when mega-mergers ruled and big banks’ share of the small end of the market fell to just 7%. The top two spots on the 2019 league rankings were won by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Rothschild & Co. Lucrative deals such as United Technologies Corp.’s $90 billion merger with Raytheon Co. kept the big banks busy. Now, while dealmaking has fallen almost 25% through Sept. 30, the volume of transactions valued at up to $500 million has seen a less severe drop, down by only 14%. A small M&A deal typically generates roughly the same fee margins compared with bigger, more complex purchases, but the segment can hardly make up for the decline in bigger transactions. In 2019, for instance, there were four deals that individually were bigger than the entire $61 billion volume of this year’s deals of $500 million or less. For Goldman Sachs, its emergence as the top adviser on smaller deals this year is also a sign that an effort to build teams dedicated to winning smaller corporate clients is paying off. Goldman Sachs bankers began fanning out across the U.S. two years ago to pitch companies once deemed too small to warrant regular attention. Its cross-markets group, which also stretches across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was launched to help the bank win more mid-sized advisory mandates. Friedland said that initially some smaller clients were skeptical. They’d ask “How committed are you to the middle market? We have seen this before,"" Friedland recalled. “And that’s true, we first started talking about this effort more than 15 years ago,"" he said. “But now we have 190 people dedicated to this part of the market and they’re not getting pulled out to do $10 billion deals when they come along, they are full-time on the $300 million deals."" Regionally, Goldman Sachs was the top ranked adviser on deals of $500 million or less in both the Americas and Asia Pacific during the first nine months of the year. It ranked fourth in Europe, where Rothschild & Co. led the pack, Bloomberg data show. Eamon Brabazon, co-head of M&A in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America, said there had been a flurry of smaller deals in the first wave of the M&A comeback. “The rationale for this is clear. Smaller deals are inherently less risky and hence it’s not surprising that we saw a disproportionate amount of smaller deals immediately post-lockdown,"" he said. A particular bright spot has been the health-care sector, where smaller deal volumes are up 38% this year. Companies’ renewed desire to access lucrative therapies for cancer and other rare diseases through acquisitions is driving the broader trend. Smaller companies in the U.S. are also keen to do deals ahead of next month’s presidential election, according to Rodney Miller, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan, which has 2,000 bankers globally working with small and midsize companies. Any overhaul of policy on capital gains tax under a Joe Biden administration could result in undesirable consequences for those looking to sell businesses, investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. wrote in a report in July. “For the last four or five months, clients have been coming to us saying, ‘Can you get my company sold before there’s a potential tax regime change?’"" Miller said.",themint

He says the then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf had attacked Kargil without informing him. ""I would have sacked the army chief if Kargil operation was conducted without informing me,"" Khan said in an interview to private news channel Samaa TV on Thursday. Khan also said that he would sack the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief if the latter asked him to resign. The comment was made in the context of three-time prime minister Sharif’s claim that the ISI chief asked him to step down in 2014 when Khan had unleashed a big protest sit-in the national capital. He said the army was keeping the country united and slammed Sharif for targeting the military establishment. ""Look at Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen; the entire Muslim world is ablaze [so] why are we safe? If it weren't for our army, our country would've been in three pieces…"" Khan said. Sharif recently made two speeches from London, where he has been staying since November 2019 on medical grounds, directly attacking the army for interference in politics and claimed that Khan came to power through its support. The powerful Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy. Khan also said that it was not the army's job to run the government and failure of a democratically elected government should not be used to impose a martial law. ""If a judge gives a wrong decision it means the judiciary has to evolve. The army has evolved as well.

Civil society activists, students, women and leaders from the Aam Aadmi Party and the Left parties gathered at the Jantar Mantar on Friday evening to voice their protest against the Hathras incident. The protest was initially supposed to be held at the India Gate, but was later shifted to Jantar Mantar owing to prohibitory orders in place in the Rajpath area. People gathered at the site wearing masks and raising slogans demanding resignation of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister and justice for the victim. ",themint
64,4,/companies/news/bytedance-working-to-resolve-us-concerns-over-tiktok-stake-sale-11601658023719.html,ByteDance working to resolve US concerns over TikTok stake sale,"Oracle Corp., which is leading the bid to buy a stake in TikTok, is also still hashing out the fine-print terms of the deal, which two weeks ago received an endorsement “in concept"" from U.S. President Donald Trump but faces skepticism from others within his administration and from the Chinese government. ByteDance is in discussions on a final proposal with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, the regulatory body that must clear any agreement. Several issues remain unresolved, including questions about data security, Chinese ownership in the new TikTok Global and a possible $5 billion education fund. Trump has said that if a deal isn’t done before Nov. 12, TikTok will be shut down in the U.S., but it’s possible that deadline could be changed if negotiations are still going on into next month, people familiar said. The process is going slowly in part because of the volume of details that need to be ironed out, said some of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the private negotiations. What’s more, the fate of TikTok Global has slipped lower on the list of priorities for the president, who’s seeking to win approval for a new Supreme Court justice and focused on his campaign for re-election, some of the people said. A representative from TikTok declined to comment, while Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Cfius doesn’t confirm, deny or comment on its work. TikTok was forced to start talks for a deal by a pair of bans Trump issued in August on the grounds that ByteDance posed a national security risk, thrusting the app into the center of the president’s confrontation with Beijing. ByteDance is fighting the U.S. administration’s orders while simultaneously trying to push a deal through. A federal judge temporarily blocked a proposed White House ban of TikTok from U.S. app stores on Sept. 27, claiming the Trump administration overstepped its authority in demanding the removal. The agreement on the table materialized last month and called for Oracle and Walmart Inc. to take minority stakes in TikTok Global, and for four of the company’s five board members to be U.S. citizens. That proposal won out over a bid from Microsoft Corp. to purchase TikTok’s U.S. assets outright. Under the plan being discussed, all the board votes will be equally weighted, one person familiar with the matter said, meaning no single board member will have greater influence than others. Walmart has said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will take one of those board seats. The retail giant is likely to have a more active role in TikTok’s products and features than some other investors, people familiar said. Walmart has touted “commercial agreements"" with TikTok, and the two sides are discussing how to integrate Walmart and TikTok features into each other’s respective apps. Walmart declined to comment on the latest discussions. Oracle, meanwhile, isn’t expected to take a board seat. The software maker’s role is more specific to TikTok’s data storage and security, but the company isn’t expected to have a role in the company’s day-to-day business or product operations, some of the people said. Still, some of the most basic aspects of the deal appear to be undecided. While Oracle and Walmart have said they will take a combined 20% stake in the new TikTok entity, Trump and Oracle have both asserted that the deal won’t move forward if the resulting company has Chinese involvement. ByteDance, meanwhile, says it plans to hold an 80% stake in the new company, and there are indications that the Chinese government will only approve a deal if ByteDance maintains a majority stake.",themint

Kapil Kaul, South Asia CEO of CAPA-Centre for Aviation said he expects the deadline for submitting bids to be extended further at least to December. “While the government is committed to Air India’s privatization and expects a successful outcome this time in spite of very challenging circumstances, it may have to sweeten the deal and make changes based on investor feedback,"" Kaul said. The deadline for submitting bids for the national carrier has already been extended several times due to the coronavirus pandemic ever since a fresh divestment process was initiated on 27 January. The government had in January sought bids for selling its entire 100% equity in the airline, including Air India’s 100% stake in no-frill subsidiary Air India Express Ltd and 50% stake in Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt. Ltd. Tata Sons, which controls the Tata group conglomerate, and had initially shown interest in bidding for Air India, is however unlikely to place a bid, said the second person. “At present, it’s a very tough call for Tata group to bid for Air India. In fact, under the current scenario, it will be very difficult for any airline to bid for Air India considering how the sector has been adversely affected by the pandemic,"" the person, who is close to the Tata group, said on condition of anonymity. A spokesperson for the Tata group declined to comment. Handing over control of Air India may help the carrier, which hasn’t made a profit since the merger with Indian Airlines in 2007, to post a financial turnaround. The path may, however, not be easy considering the global aviation market has been one of the worst-affected by the pandemic and could potentially be one of the last few sectors to stage a recovery.",themint

The Congress leader also accused the Centre of having weakened laws like MNREGA and Right to Information (RTI) Act which her party's government had enacted to protect the interests of common people. ""Some people swear by Gandhi jis name but demolish his ideals and principles through their actions. Anarchy, atrocity and mistreatment prevail everywhere. An environment of discrimination has been created in the society where atrocities are being inflicted on innocent people,"" she said. She was virtually addressing a 'Gandhi Chetna Rally' at Congress party office in Motihari, the headquarters of East Champaran district in Bihar, to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. It was in Champaran where Gandhi had experimented with 'Satyagraha' for the first time in India. It would later become his most potent weapon in the fight against the British rule. ""Enough is enough. I would like to say that some people are running the government by creating an atmosphere of emotion, confusion and fear (bhavna, bhram aur bhay). You (people) need to remain alert and cautious and take the right decisions, she said. ""We have to fight it out together and that will be our real tribute to Gandhi ji.""

In her speech, which many saw as the launch of her party's campaign for the Bihar elections, the process of which has already started, Sonia Gandhi said the common man was always at the centre of Congress's welfare programmes. ""But whenever the Congress tries to work for the development of the poor, certain forces stand up against the party for their vested interest,"" she alleged. She said the Modi government first ridiculed the MNREGA, the UPA government's rural livelihood scheme, but later continued with it. ""Just imagine what could have happened if there was no MNREGA during the COVID pandemic? People in large numbers would have starved,"" she asserted. She also drew a parallel between the times when Mahatma Gandhi launched Champaran Satyagraha for the farmers, who were being forced by the British to grow indigo, and now when agriculturists were up in arms against the new farm laws. ""A handful of people are getting richer, while millions are losing their livelihood,"" she said. The Congress leader said lakhs of youth were losing jobs as small industries were closing down and big public sector undertakings being privatised. The RTI Act introduced by the previous Congress government for bringing in greater transparency in governance has been diluted, she alleged. ""You keep asking questions through RTI but will not get suitable replies,"" she said.

The billionaire’s group had been in talks with overseas funds for the capital, local media had reported earlier. Ambani, 63, who’s expanded his oil-focused conglomerate into telecommunications, technology and retail, is in the midst of raising cash from the assets he created along the way from the diversification. The investment by his own group companies in the trust contrasts with the approach of his digital venture, Jio Platforms Ltd., which mopped up more than $20 billion this year by selling 33% to investors including Facebook Inc. and Google. Reliance Industries will hold 48.4% of Jio Digital Fibre Pvt. Ltd., according to the filing.

The tycoon is seeking to dominate telecommunications as he sees it as a platform to deliver many services online -- e-commerce, entertainment, education and health care among others. The transformation of Mumbai-based Reliance is a bet on India’s consumers, as millions use smartphones to access such services. Ambani has also started selling stakes in his retail unit. KKR & Co., Silver Lake and General Atlantic and Mubadala have invested more than $3 billion in the business. Reliance had previously sold stakes in a separate investment trust that held the group’s wireless tower assets to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for 248 billion rupees ($3.4 billion). Reliance Industries, in its annual report in June, had mentioned ongoing talks with potential investors for buying into the trust holding fiber assets.

Mr. Turner isn’t the least bit worried that coronavirus-related restrictions will limit skiing in Park City this year. “It’s a ski mountain, but it’s also a beautiful place,"" says Mr. Turner, 45, a wealth management adviser. “There are other things to do there."" For years, ski resorts have worked on diversifying their attractions to bring in more people by adding all kinds of non-ski amenities. The test is this coming season, when some might not even be able to open their skiing operations. The early results are looking good, as home sales and prices have soared despite the uncertainty. “This was the busiest summer selling season ever,"" says Ben Fisher, a broker with Summit Sotheby’s International Realty in Park City. The high end there has been particularly strong, with sales of single-family homes over $2 million up 50% between March and August 2020 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Park City MLS. One house sold for all cash and $350,000 over its $15 million list price just a few days after it went on the market. In Colorado, Telluride saw the dollar volume of home sales increase 54% through the month of August compared with a year earlier, with $125 million in sales in August alone—a one-month record, according to George Harvey, broker and owner with The Harvey Team. Aspen recorded 65 single-family home sales through August this year, up from 50 for the same period in 2019, while the dollar value of the sales is up by 49%, according to Sotheby’s International Realty. Since March 1, 46 houses over $10 million have sold and 24 are under contract. “I’ve never seen anything like it. The high end is flying off the shelf,"" says David Viehman, a broker with Engel & Völkers in Jackson Hole, where the total number of sales over $3 million is up 55% over a year earlier and there have been 21 sales over $10 million compared with five sales in that bracket in 2019, a 320% increase. Skiing was initially the reason Keith Seigerman started looking for a second home in Aspen three years ago, but the pandemic played a role in why he finally closed on a four-bedroom, 3,200-square-foot home on 3 acres, 7 miles from the center of town, for $2 million this summer. He likes that Aspen is hard to get to, with limited direct flights, and that it has a remote feel. He also appreciates how strictly the town has been enforcing social-distancing rules, a feat he feels is easier there because of the small size of the community. “It’s tucked away, quiet, peaceful and safe,"" says the 61-year-old contractor from Southampton, N.Y. “Covid accelerated our decision,"" says Carter Westfall, who, with his wife, Kate West, bought a three-bedroom, 2,550-square-foot house in Wilson, Wyo., near the Jackson Hole ski area, for $1.75 million in August. The couple had been thinking about relocating from Oakland, Calif., ever since Mr. Westfall started a freeride snowboard competition tour with Travis Rice, a renowned Jackson professional snowboarder. But Mr. Westfall and Ms. West, a creative producer for The North Face, probably would have waited another year to buy if they hadn’t noticed that Covid-19 pandemic was increasing demand for houses there, pushing prices higher. At the same time, they worried people wanting to leave the Bay Area because of the city’s limits during the coronavirus crisis would lower the price they could get for their house in Oakland, which they have since sold. Mr. Westfall is aware there will be changes at the Jackson Hole ski resort this year, but says they are there for the long haul. People fleeing cities in search of homes with more of a connection to the outdoors are driving much of the demand, real-estate agents say. What started as requests for long-term rentals in April accelerated into sales starting in June, says Kristen Barber, a broker with Stein Eriksen Realty in Park City. This summer, Michelle and Roland Weedon bought a two-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot condo at the Pendry Residences, a residential community still under construction in Park City. The Weedons, who live in Huntington Beach, Calif., where he owns a mortgage company and she is a real-estate consultant, already own a 6,000-square-foot house in Park City that they built three years ago and which is valued at around $5 million. But they thought lots of people would want to get away to wide open spaces and bought the condo as an investment. They are also eager to use the condo’s on-site amenities, including the pool and bar, spa, fitness center, ski concierge and slope-side parking. “People are looking to get out,"" says Mr. Weedon. After the pandemic hit, Claire Nathel second-guessed her decision to buy a 4,000-square-foot penthouse in Deer Valley, Utah, for around $3.5 million. She and her husband, Ira Nathel, had put down a deposit in January but started to falter in May. “We felt like it wasn’t the right time, with people losing jobs,"" says Ms. Nathel, 48, who owns a wholesale produce company in the Bronx. She also felt uncertain about how the pandemic would affect travel and skiing. But she went ahead with the purchase because the closed-in feeling she had in New York made her grateful for a space to go. She and her husband hope to spend a couple of months a year in Utah when their home is finished. Gary Feldman, a broker with the Gary Feldman Group at Aspen Snowmass Sotheby’s, says one difference he noticed this summer was that buyers didn’t care as much how close they were to the ski mountains. He sold his own three-bedroom, four-bathroom, glass-and-wood house along the Roaring Fork River near Snowmass for $4.8 million and is moving about 7 miles away to Basalt, where he says buyers are now “coming from everywhere."" Keith Orr, who bought Mr. Feldman’s house, also saw the pandemic as an opportunity: It made it easier to sell his 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom ski condo in the center of Aspen. Mr. Orr, 58, a car salesman from Dallas and Texarkana, said it took 10 days to sell the condo for $5.3 million—he paid $3.2 million for it seven years ago. He said there were dozens of showings scheduled for his condo after two days on the market. “I’ve never experienced such a thing,"" he says.",themint

Mr. Trump said in the presidential debate Tuesday that he had spoken to Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, and a vaccine was weeks away. Mr. Trump also said he disagreed with federal health officials who had said a vaccine wouldn’t be widely available until next summer. The president’s comments at the debate, as well as remarks beforehand saying he sought a vaccine’s authorization before Election Day, have touched off partisan fighting over whether his administration would push for a vaccine’s use before it has been fully vetted. They come as surveys show significant numbers of Americans harbor concerns about taking a vaccine, partly out of fear a shot might be unsafe. Dr. Bourla wrote that he was disappointed that Covid-19 vaccines were discussed during the presidential debate “in political terms rather than scientific facts."" He added, “People, who are understandably confused, don’t know whom or what to believe."" Pfizer is recruiting 44,000 people to enroll at more than 100 sites across six countries to test its vaccine in a late-stage study. Dr. Bourla has said in public appearances that the company could know results about whether it works as early as this month. A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company and partner BioNTech SE expect “a conclusive readout on efficacy is likely by the end of October."" Mr. Bourla said in the letter that he can’t predict exactly when, or if, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would authorize the company’s vaccine. “But I do know that the world will be safer if we stop talking about the vaccines’ delivery in political terms and focus instead on a rigorous independent scientific evaluation and a robust independent approval process,"" he wrote. Corrections & Amplifications Pfizer is testing its vaccine at more than 100 sites in six countries. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the testing was taking place in more than 100 countries. (Corrected on Oct. 1)",themint

Trump said early Friday that he has tested positive along with his wife and one of his closest aides, throwing his campaign into deeper disarray just one month before the election. Meadows said he himself has tested negative, along with other close Trump aides including his son-in-law Jared Kushner. “The American people can rest assured that we have a president that is not only on the job, will remain on the job,"" Meadows told reporters, without wearing a mask. “I’m optimistic that he’ll have a very quick and speedy recovery."" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said he’s tested negative for the coronavirus, joining Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in avoiding Covid-19 so far. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a fresh stimulus package this week have yet to break the impasse that’s persisted for months, said things might change in the wake of Trump’s infection. “This kind of changes the dynamic,"" Pelosi said on MSNBC Friday. She has criticized the Trump administration for paying insufficient attention to containing the coronavirus and she said the current situation may change the White House stance on pandemic relief. “Maybe this will be the moment where people will say, OK, masks, sanitation, treatment,"" she said. “It might be a learning experience,"" she said of the news. The speaker said she was tested Friday morning, and awaits the results. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, sent their good wishes to Trump and First Lady Melania Trump after they tested positive for coronavirus. “Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family,"" Biden tweeted. Biden and Trump faced off in a debate Tuesday night. Biden has criticized the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris tweeted wishes for a “speedy recovery."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- among the global leaders who has governed from home while in isolation during the pandemic -- said he hoped Trump would get well soon and “have a full recovery from this virus.""

""Visited the 'Atal Tunnel, Rohtang' to review the preparations for the inaugural ceremony to be held tomorrow. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate the tunnel to the nation. This 9.02 km long 'Engineering Marvel' will connect Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year,"" Singh said in a tweet. Singh, who is on a two-day visit to Himachal Pradesh, also visited DRDO's Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) in Manali. The Atal Tunnel has been built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3000 m (10,000 feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL). It reduces the road distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the time by about 4 to 5 hours. The South Portal (SP) of the tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3060 metres while North Portal (NP) of the tunnel is located near village Teling, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres. It is horseshoe-shaped, single tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of eight metres and an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres. The tunnel has been designed for traffic density of 3000 cars per day and 1500 trucks per day with a maximum speed of 80 km/hr. The decision to construct a strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass was taken on June 3, 2000 when late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister. The foundation stone for the Access Road to the South Portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002. The Union Cabinet decided in 2019 to name the Rohtang Tunnel as Atal Tunnel to honour the contribution made by the former Prime Minister. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) overcame major geological, terrain and weather challenges in the construction of the tunnel. (ANI)",themint
