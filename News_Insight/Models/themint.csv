I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands."" President Donald Trump, who faces Biden in the November presidential election, is experiencing mild symptoms after testing positive for coronavirus, administration officials said on Friday, as the White House and election campaign scrambled to adjust to the bombshell development.

1,/market/stock-market-news/wall-street-s-big-banks-focus-on-small-deals-11601659625397.html,Wall Street’s big banks focus on small deals,"But with the pandemic-induced slowdown in dealmaking this year, bankers who have been talking about embracing smaller clients for ages are finally doing it. They’re swooping in on smaller transactions -- those of $500 million or less -- winning assignments to an extent not seen in five years. And in so doing, they are elbowing out some lesser rivals that typically make their bread and butter advising smaller clients. “When the larger deals are slow, people pick up the smaller deals,"" said David Friedland, global head of mergers and acquisitions in the cross-markets team at Goldman Sachs. In the first nine months of the year, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley advised on about $61 billion of announced transactions in the global small and midsize segment, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That gave them 9.2% of that market, their largest slice since 2015, and enough for the banks to dominate the advisory rankings. It’s a big change from last year when mega-mergers ruled and big banks’ share of the small end of the market fell to just 7%. The top two spots on the 2019 league rankings were won by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and Rothschild & Co. Lucrative deals such as United Technologies Corp.’s $90 billion merger with Raytheon Co. kept the big banks busy. Now, while dealmaking has fallen almost 25% through Sept. 30, the volume of transactions valued at up to $500 million has seen a less severe drop, down by only 14%. A small M&A deal typically generates roughly the same fee margins compared with bigger, more complex purchases, but the segment can hardly make up for the decline in bigger transactions. In 2019, for instance, there were four deals that individually were bigger than the entire $61 billion volume of this year’s deals of $500 million or less. For Goldman Sachs, its emergence as the top adviser on smaller deals this year is also a sign that an effort to build teams dedicated to winning smaller corporate clients is paying off. Goldman Sachs bankers began fanning out across the U.S. two years ago to pitch companies once deemed too small to warrant regular attention. Its cross-markets group, which also stretches across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was launched to help the bank win more mid-sized advisory mandates. Friedland said that initially some smaller clients were skeptical. They’d ask “How committed are you to the middle market? We have seen this before,"" Friedland recalled. “And that’s true, we first started talking about this effort more than 15 years ago,"" he said. “But now we have 190 people dedicated to this part of the market and they’re not getting pulled out to do $10 billion deals when they come along, they are full-time on the $300 million deals."" Regionally, Goldman Sachs was the top ranked adviser on deals of $500 million or less in both the Americas and Asia Pacific during the first nine months of the year. It ranked fourth in Europe, where Rothschild & Co. led the pack, Bloomberg data show. Eamon Brabazon, co-head of M&A in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America, said there had been a flurry of smaller deals in the first wave of the M&A comeback. “The rationale for this is clear. Smaller deals are inherently less risky and hence it’s not surprising that we saw a disproportionate amount of smaller deals immediately post-lockdown,"" he said. A particular bright spot has been the health-care sector, where smaller deal volumes are up 38% this year. Companies’ renewed desire to access lucrative therapies for cancer and other rare diseases through acquisitions is driving the broader trend. Smaller companies in the U.S. are also keen to do deals ahead of next month’s presidential election, according to Rodney Miller, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan, which has 2,000 bankers globally working with small and midsize companies. Any overhaul of policy on capital gains tax under a Joe Biden administration could result in undesirable consequences for those looking to sell businesses, investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. wrote in a report in July. “For the last four or five months, clients have been coming to us saying, ‘Can you get my company sold before there’s a potential tax regime change?’"" Miller said."

He says the then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf had attacked Kargil without informing him. ""I would have sacked the army chief if Kargil operation was conducted without informing me,"" Khan said in an interview to private news channel Samaa TV on Thursday. Khan also said that he would sack the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief if the latter asked him to resign. The comment was made in the context of three-time prime minister Sharif’s claim that the ISI chief asked him to step down in 2014 when Khan had unleashed a big protest sit-in the national capital. He said the army was keeping the country united and slammed Sharif for targeting the military establishment. ""Look at Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen; the entire Muslim world is ablaze [so] why are we safe? If it weren't for our army, our country would've been in three pieces…"" Khan said. Sharif recently made two speeches from London, where he has been staying since November 2019 on medical grounds, directly attacking the army for interference in politics and claimed that Khan came to power through its support. The powerful Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy. Khan also said that it was not the army's job to run the government and failure of a democratically elected government should not be used to impose a martial law. ""If a judge gives a wrong decision it means the judiciary has to evolve. The army has evolved as well. Contemporary civil-military relations are the best in history because they are all working in their spheres,"" he said. He also claimed that the army was standing by the government in all matters including relations with India, opening of the Kartarpur Corridor and the coronavirus pandemic. "

""The Hathras victim cannot get justice till UP CM resigns and the Supreme Court takes cognisance of the issue. These kind of culprits should be punished as soon as possible so that others get scared before committing such crimes,"" he said, addressing the protesters. ""We will go to Hathras and till the time the matter doesn't come to Delhi, there is no chance of getting justice,"" Azad added. Civil society activists, students, women and leaders from the Aam Aadmi Party and the Left parties gathered at the Jantar Mantar on Friday evening to voice their protest against the Hathras incident. The protest was initially supposed to be held at the India Gate, but was later shifted to Jantar Mantar owing to prohibitory orders in place in the Rajpath area. People gathered at the site wearing masks and raising slogans demanding resignation of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister and justice for the victim. "
4,/companies/news/bytedance-working-to-resolve-us-concerns-over-tiktok-stake-sale-11601658023719.html,ByteDance working to resolve US concerns over TikTok stake sale,"Oracle Corp., which is leading the bid to buy a stake in TikTok, is also still hashing out the fine-print terms of the deal, which two weeks ago received an endorsement “in concept"" from U.S. President Donald Trump but faces skepticism from others within his administration and from the Chinese government. ByteDance is in discussions on a final proposal with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, the regulatory body that must clear any agreement. Several issues remain unresolved, including questions about data security, Chinese ownership in the new TikTok Global and a possible $5 billion education fund. Trump has said that if a deal isn’t done before Nov. 12, TikTok will be shut down in the U.S., but it’s possible that deadline could be changed if negotiations are still going on into next month, people familiar said. The process is going slowly in part because of the volume of details that need to be ironed out, said some of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the private negotiations. What’s more, the fate of TikTok Global has slipped lower on the list of priorities for the president, who’s seeking to win approval for a new Supreme Court justice and focused on his campaign for re-election, some of the people said. A representative from TikTok declined to comment, while Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Cfius doesn’t confirm, deny or comment on its work. TikTok was forced to start talks for a deal by a pair of bans Trump issued in August on the grounds that ByteDance posed a national security risk, thrusting the app into the center of the president’s confrontation with Beijing. ByteDance is fighting the U.S. administration’s orders while simultaneously trying to push a deal through. A federal judge temporarily blocked a proposed White House ban of TikTok from U.S. app stores on Sept. 27, claiming the Trump administration overstepped its authority in demanding the removal. The agreement on the table materialized last month and called for Oracle and Walmart Inc. to take minority stakes in TikTok Global, and for four of the company’s five board members to be U.S. citizens. That proposal won out over a bid from Microsoft Corp. to purchase TikTok’s U.S. assets outright. Under the plan being discussed, all the board votes will be equally weighted, one person familiar with the matter said, meaning no single board member will have greater influence than others. Walmart has said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon will take one of those board seats. The retail giant is likely to have a more active role in TikTok’s products and features than some other investors, people familiar said. Walmart has touted “commercial agreements"" with TikTok, and the two sides are discussing how to integrate Walmart and TikTok features into each other’s respective apps. Walmart declined to comment on the latest discussions. Oracle, meanwhile, isn’t expected to take a board seat. The software maker’s role is more specific to TikTok’s data storage and security, but the company isn’t expected to have a role in the company’s day-to-day business or product operations, some of the people said. Still, some of the most basic aspects of the deal appear to be undecided. While Oracle and Walmart have said they will take a combined 20% stake in the new TikTok entity, Trump and Oracle have both asserted that the deal won’t move forward if the resulting company has Chinese involvement. ByteDance, meanwhile, says it plans to hold an 80% stake in the new company, and there are indications that the Chinese government will only approve a deal if ByteDance maintains a majority stake."

The government, which announced a  ₹1.7 trillion humanitarian package in March, and subsequently followed it up with a  ₹20 trillion economic package, is keeping a close tab on their implementation, the person said. The package also included free supply of food grain, pulses and cooking gas refills. Other than cash transfers, financial support has been given to construction workers amounting to  ₹4,987 crore under the package. Under the liquidity boosting steps, people have availed of non-refundable advance of about  ₹10,615 crore from EPFO accounts. The person also said that as on 30 September, about 30 crore man days of employment has been provided to migrant workers and more than  ₹27,000 crore have been spent under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan. The Central government has also transferred Rs. 2.17 trillion to state governments as devolution of their share of taxes in the first five months of this fiscal which is Rs. 37,629 crore lower than that of the previous year.

6,/news/india/bidders-want-govt-to-sweeten-ai-deal-further-11601657530782.html,Bidders want govt to sweeten Air India deal further,"They said the requirement that a potential buyer absorb  ₹23,286.5 crore of the carrier’s total debt of  ₹60,074 crore, has made it difficult to sell the airline in its second attempt, after the initial failure in 2018. “At that time too, the airline’s debt pile emerged as the primary worry for bidders following which the government decided to transfer around  ₹40,000 crore of the debt to Air India Assets Holding Ltd, a special purpose vehicle created for this,"" said the first person cited above. Kapil Kaul, South Asia CEO of CAPA-Centre for Aviation said he expects the deadline for submitting bids to be extended further at least to December. “While the government is committed to Air India’s privatization and expects a successful outcome this time in spite of very challenging circumstances, it may have to sweeten the deal and make changes based on investor feedback,"" Kaul said. The deadline for submitting bids for the national carrier has already been extended several times due to the coronavirus pandemic ever since a fresh divestment process was initiated on 27 January. The government had in January sought bids for selling its entire 100% equity in the airline, including Air India’s 100% stake in no-frill subsidiary Air India Express Ltd and 50% stake in Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt. Ltd. Tata Sons, which controls the Tata group conglomerate, and had initially shown interest in bidding for Air India, is however unlikely to place a bid, said the second person. “At present, it’s a very tough call for Tata group to bid for Air India. In fact, under the current scenario, it will be very difficult for any airline to bid for Air India considering how the sector has been adversely affected by the pandemic,"" the person, who is close to the Tata group, said on condition of anonymity. A spokesperson for the Tata group declined to comment. Handing over control of Air India may help the carrier, which hasn’t made a profit since the merger with Indian Airlines in 2007, to post a financial turnaround. The path may, however, not be easy considering the global aviation market has been one of the worst-affected by the pandemic and could potentially be one of the last few sectors to stage a recovery."

The Congress leader also accused the Centre of having weakened laws like MNREGA and Right to Information (RTI) Act which her party's government had enacted to protect the interests of common people. ""Some people swear by Gandhi jis name but demolish his ideals and principles through their actions. Anarchy, atrocity and mistreatment prevail everywhere. An environment of discrimination has been created in the society where atrocities are being inflicted on innocent people,"" she said. She was virtually addressing a 'Gandhi Chetna Rally' at Congress party office in Motihari, the headquarters of East Champaran district in Bihar, to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. It was in Champaran where Gandhi had experimented with 'Satyagraha' for the first time in India. It would later become his most potent weapon in the fight against the British rule. ""Enough is enough. I would like to say that some people are running the government by creating an atmosphere of emotion, confusion and fear (bhavna, bhram aur bhay). You (people) need to remain alert and cautious and take the right decisions, she said. ""We have to fight it out together and that will be our real tribute to Gandhi ji."" The Congress leader also unveiled a life-size statue of the Mahatma, and asserted his ideals are the ""soul and spirit"" of her party. In her speech, which many saw as the launch of her party's campaign for the Bihar elections, the process of which has already started, Sonia Gandhi said the common man was always at the centre of Congress's welfare programmes. ""But whenever the Congress tries to work for the development of the poor, certain forces stand up against the party for their vested interest,"" she alleged. She said the Modi government first ridiculed the MNREGA, the UPA government's rural livelihood scheme, but later continued with it. ""Just imagine what could have happened if there was no MNREGA during the COVID pandemic? People in large numbers would have starved,"" she asserted. She also drew a parallel between the times when Mahatma Gandhi launched Champaran Satyagraha for the farmers, who were being forced by the British to grow indigo, and now when agriculturists were up in arms against the new farm laws. ""A handful of people are getting richer, while millions are losing their livelihood,"" she said. The Congress leader said lakhs of youth were losing jobs as small industries were closing down and big public sector undertakings being privatised. The RTI Act introduced by the previous Congress government for bringing in greater transparency in governance has been diluted, she alleged. ""You keep asking questions through RTI but will not get suitable replies,"" she said. She said several laws enacted by the UPA governments for the welfare of women, workers, the health and education sectors, have been ""weakened"".

The billionaire’s group had been in talks with overseas funds for the capital, local media had reported earlier. Ambani, 63, who’s expanded his oil-focused conglomerate into telecommunications, technology and retail, is in the midst of raising cash from the assets he created along the way from the diversification. The investment by his own group companies in the trust contrasts with the approach of his digital venture, Jio Platforms Ltd., which mopped up more than $20 billion this year by selling 33% to investors including Facebook Inc. and Google. Reliance Industries will hold 48.4% of Jio Digital Fibre Pvt. Ltd., according to the filing. After the success of his wireless carrier, which is now India’s No. 1 with 400 million users, Asia’s richest man is offering broadband services across the country through his fiber-optic network. The tycoon is seeking to dominate telecommunications as he sees it as a platform to deliver many services online -- e-commerce, entertainment, education and health care among others. The transformation of Mumbai-based Reliance is a bet on India’s consumers, as millions use smartphones to access such services. Ambani has also started selling stakes in his retail unit. KKR & Co., Silver Lake and General Atlantic and Mubadala have invested more than $3 billion in the business. Reliance had previously sold stakes in a separate investment trust that held the group’s wireless tower assets to Brookfield Asset Management Inc. for 248 billion rupees ($3.4 billion). Reliance Industries, in its annual report in June, had mentioned ongoing talks with potential investors for buying into the trust holding fiber assets. The retail-to-refining group owns a network of 1.1 million kilometers of fiber optic cable across India that penetrate over 1,600 Indian cities and towns."

No rape incidents should happen in the country, Kejriwal added. ""The entire country wants that the culprits should be given stringent punishment. Some people feel that attempts are being made to save them. At this time, the victim's family needs all the possible help,"" Arvind Kejriwal said, according to ANI reports. The young woman succumbed to the severe injuries she suffered when she was allegedly gang-raped and assaulted by four upper-caste men – later arrested – in the fields at her village in Hathras on September 14. She was cremated in Hathras in the dead of the night with family members saying they were not allowed to bring the body home one last time. But police claimed they had the family's consent for the cremation. Protests at Jantar Mantar  Jantar Mantar in central Delhi buzzed with activity on Friday as the venue witnessed perhaps its first biggest protest ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began, with hundreds of protesters gathering there to demand justice for the Hathras murder victim. Social distancing norms and wearing of masks went for a toss as many of the protesters raised slogans without wearing masks. A sea of people from different walks of life — students, activists, citizens and political leaders — attended the protest which was initially supposed to be held at India Gate but was shifted to Jantar Mantar owing to the prohibitory orders in place around Rajpath area. People also held a candlelight vigil for the Hathras victim as slogans demanding the resignation of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanth and seeking justice for the victim rent the air."

Mr. Turner isn’t the least bit worried that coronavirus-related restrictions will limit skiing in Park City this year. “It’s a ski mountain, but it’s also a beautiful place,"" says Mr. Turner, 45, a wealth management adviser. “There are other things to do there."" For years, ski resorts have worked on diversifying their attractions to bring in more people by adding all kinds of non-ski amenities. The test is this coming season, when some might not even be able to open their skiing operations. The early results are looking good, as home sales and prices have soared despite the uncertainty. “This was the busiest summer selling season ever,"" says Ben Fisher, a broker with Summit Sotheby’s International Realty in Park City. The high end there has been particularly strong, with sales of single-family homes over $2 million up 50% between March and August 2020 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Park City MLS. One house sold for all cash and $350,000 over its $15 million list price just a few days after it went on the market. In Colorado, Telluride saw the dollar volume of home sales increase 54% through the month of August compared with a year earlier, with $125 million in sales in August alone—a one-month record, according to George Harvey, broker and owner with The Harvey Team. Aspen recorded 65 single-family home sales through August this year, up from 50 for the same period in 2019, while the dollar value of the sales is up by 49%, according to Sotheby’s International Realty. Since March 1, 46 houses over $10 million have sold and 24 are under contract. “I’ve never seen anything like it. The high end is flying off the shelf,"" says David Viehman, a broker with Engel & Völkers in Jackson Hole, where the total number of sales over $3 million is up 55% over a year earlier and there have been 21 sales over $10 million compared with five sales in that bracket in 2019, a 320% increase. Skiing was initially the reason Keith Seigerman started looking for a second home in Aspen three years ago, but the pandemic played a role in why he finally closed on a four-bedroom, 3,200-square-foot home on 3 acres, 7 miles from the center of town, for $2 million this summer. He likes that Aspen is hard to get to, with limited direct flights, and that it has a remote feel. He also appreciates how strictly the town has been enforcing social-distancing rules, a feat he feels is easier there because of the small size of the community. “It’s tucked away, quiet, peaceful and safe,"" says the 61-year-old contractor from Southampton, N.Y. “Covid accelerated our decision,"" says Carter Westfall, who, with his wife, Kate West, bought a three-bedroom, 2,550-square-foot house in Wilson, Wyo., near the Jackson Hole ski area, for $1.75 million in August. The couple had been thinking about relocating from Oakland, Calif., ever since Mr. Westfall started a freeride snowboard competition tour with Travis Rice, a renowned Jackson professional snowboarder. But Mr. Westfall and Ms. West, a creative producer for The North Face, probably would have waited another year to buy if they hadn’t noticed that Covid-19 pandemic was increasing demand for houses there, pushing prices higher. At the same time, they worried people wanting to leave the Bay Area because of the city’s limits during the coronavirus crisis would lower the price they could get for their house in Oakland, which they have since sold. Mr. Westfall is aware there will be changes at the Jackson Hole ski resort this year, but says they are there for the long haul. People fleeing cities in search of homes with more of a connection to the outdoors are driving much of the demand, real-estate agents say. What started as requests for long-term rentals in April accelerated into sales starting in June, says Kristen Barber, a broker with Stein Eriksen Realty in Park City. This summer, Michelle and Roland Weedon bought a two-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot condo at the Pendry Residences, a residential community still under construction in Park City. The Weedons, who live in Huntington Beach, Calif., where he owns a mortgage company and she is a real-estate consultant, already own a 6,000-square-foot house in Park City that they built three years ago and which is valued at around $5 million. But they thought lots of people would want to get away to wide open spaces and bought the condo as an investment. They are also eager to use the condo’s on-site amenities, including the pool and bar, spa, fitness center, ski concierge and slope-side parking. “People are looking to get out,"" says Mr. Weedon. After the pandemic hit, Claire Nathel second-guessed her decision to buy a 4,000-square-foot penthouse in Deer Valley, Utah, for around $3.5 million. She and her husband, Ira Nathel, had put down a deposit in January but started to falter in May. “We felt like it wasn’t the right time, with people losing jobs,"" says Ms. Nathel, 48, who owns a wholesale produce company in the Bronx. She also felt uncertain about how the pandemic would affect travel and skiing. But she went ahead with the purchase because the closed-in feeling she had in New York made her grateful for a space to go. She and her husband hope to spend a couple of months a year in Utah when their home is finished. Gary Feldman, a broker with the Gary Feldman Group at Aspen Snowmass Sotheby’s, says one difference he noticed this summer was that buyers didn’t care as much how close they were to the ski mountains. He sold his own three-bedroom, four-bathroom, glass-and-wood house along the Roaring Fork River near Snowmass for $4.8 million and is moving about 7 miles away to Basalt, where he says buyers are now “coming from everywhere."" Keith Orr, who bought Mr. Feldman’s house, also saw the pandemic as an opportunity: It made it easier to sell his 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom ski condo in the center of Aspen. Mr. Orr, 58, a car salesman from Dallas and Texarkana, said it took 10 days to sell the condo for $5.3 million—he paid $3.2 million for it seven years ago. He said there were dozens of showings scheduled for his condo after two days on the market. “I’ve never experienced such a thing,"" he says."

Mr. Trump said in the presidential debate Tuesday that he had spoken to Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, and a vaccine was weeks away. Mr. Trump also said he disagreed with federal health officials who had said a vaccine wouldn’t be widely available until next summer. The president’s comments at the debate, as well as remarks beforehand saying he sought a vaccine’s authorization before Election Day, have touched off partisan fighting over whether his administration would push for a vaccine’s use before it has been fully vetted. They come as surveys show significant numbers of Americans harbor concerns about taking a vaccine, partly out of fear a shot might be unsafe. Dr. Bourla wrote that he was disappointed that Covid-19 vaccines were discussed during the presidential debate “in political terms rather than scientific facts."" He added, “People, who are understandably confused, don’t know whom or what to believe."" Pfizer is recruiting 44,000 people to enroll at more than 100 sites across six countries to test its vaccine in a late-stage study. Dr. Bourla has said in public appearances that the company could know results about whether it works as early as this month. A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company and partner BioNTech SE expect “a conclusive readout on efficacy is likely by the end of October."" Mr. Bourla said in the letter that he can’t predict exactly when, or if, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would authorize the company’s vaccine. “But I do know that the world will be safer if we stop talking about the vaccines’ delivery in political terms and focus instead on a rigorous independent scientific evaluation and a robust independent approval process,"" he wrote.

National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said he’s tested negative for the coronavirus, joining Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in avoiding Covid-19 so far. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a fresh stimulus package this week have yet to break the impasse that’s persisted for months, said things might change in the wake of Trump’s infection. “This kind of changes the dynamic,"" Pelosi said on MSNBC Friday. She has criticized the Trump administration for paying insufficient attention to containing the coronavirus and she said the current situation may change the White House stance on pandemic relief. “Maybe this will be the moment where people will say, OK, masks, sanitation, treatment,"" she said. “It might be a learning experience,"" she said of the news. The speaker said she was tested Friday morning, and awaits the results. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, sent their good wishes to Trump and First Lady Melania Trump after they tested positive for coronavirus. “Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family,"" Biden tweeted. Biden and Trump faced off in a debate Tuesday night. Biden has criticized the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris tweeted wishes for a “speedy recovery."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- among the global leaders who has governed from home while in isolation during the pandemic -- said he hoped Trump would get well soon and “have a full recovery from this virus.""

""Visited the 'Atal Tunnel, Rohtang' to review the preparations for the inaugural ceremony to be held tomorrow. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will dedicate the tunnel to the nation. This 9.02 km long 'Engineering Marvel' will connect Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year,"" Singh said in a tweet. Singh, who is on a two-day visit to Himachal Pradesh, also visited DRDO's Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) in Manali. The Atal Tunnel has been built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3000 m (10,000 feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL). It reduces the road distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the time by about 4 to 5 hours. The South Portal (SP) of the tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3060 metres while North Portal (NP) of the tunnel is located near village Teling, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres. It is horseshoe-shaped, single tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of eight metres and an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres. The tunnel has been designed for traffic density of 3000 cars per day and 1500 trucks per day with a maximum speed of 80 km/hr. The decision to construct a strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass was taken on June 3, 2000 when late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister. The foundation stone for the Access Road to the South Portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002. The Union Cabinet decided in 2019 to name the Rohtang Tunnel as Atal Tunnel to honour the contribution made by the former Prime Minister. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) overcame major geological, terrain and weather challenges in the construction of the tunnel. (ANI)"
