Last week, the Telangana State Film Chamber of Commerce wrote to the state government to reconsider the cap on ticket pricing besides asking producers to hold on to films until October and not opt for direct-to-digital releases. Theatres are also asking to lift curbs on occupancy, which is capped at 50% and seeking permission for night shows without curfew. \\n\\n\\tUnlike the last lockdown from which exhibitors in the south had seen substantial recovery thanks to Vijay’s blockbuster Tamil film Master, Pillai said there are no films to come to their rescue this time. While Fahadh Faasil’s Malik and Dhanush’s Jagame Thandiram are among the many titles that have migrated to OTT, Telugu flicks like Narappa and Drushyam 2, both starring Venkatesh, and Virata Parvam featuring Sai Pallavi and Rana Daggubati are also in talks with platforms. \\n\\n\\t“There is definite change (among southern audiences) and the old star craze is not there, though the impact may not be as strong as the north,\" Pillai said. Even big star films could see a drop in collections after the first weekend, going forward, Pillai said. At the same time, Mukesh Mehta, founder of Malayalam film production and distribution company E4 Entertainment pointed out that while everyone is noticing these big films, several small films may never even see the light of the day with no digital platform or satellite television channel ready to buy them. \\n\\n\\tFilm exhibitors, however, are placing their bets on the inherent movie-going culture in the south to help the industry bounce back. Rajendar Singh Jyala, chief programming officer at INOX Leisure Ltd said the southern industry has seen multiple releases every week even pre-covid and out of the seven to eight at least two to three grab eyeballs, and that will continue.',\n",

The “market correction\" would ensure tourism, industrial and retail sectors function normally, it added. \\n\\n\\tThe company has claimed to have established India’s largest RT-PCR and biosafety level 3 testing laboratory, which is capable of handling 1 lakh samples a day, and will be led by an army of 500 medical representatives trained by Mayo Clinic, US.  \\n\\n\\tThe company has also launched an Allied Medical Services Training Academy to address the issue of India’s manpower crisis for covid- 19 RT-PCR sample collection, and is currently training over 1,000 individuals as part of its nation-wide human resources deployment to fight the pandemic. \\n\\n\\tEarlier in 2020, PathStore’s parent company GeneStore France in joint venture with SpiceHealth launched the RT-PCR mobile laboratories with  ₹499 testing service. GeneStore has exited the Joint Venture partnership with SpiceHealth in January 2021. \\n\\n\\t“The PathStore covid-19 test will be a major shot in the arm to the Indian and global testing strategies in the fightback against covid-19. We find testing cost is one of the major impediments for the economically vulnerable sections in accessing high quality covid-19 diagnostics facilities. PathStore’s unique mission and challenge is to deliver an international quality of its laboratory testing and customer service at a price point that is accessible to over 80% of the Indian population,\" Anubhav Anusha, Global CEO, GeneStore said.',\n",

Based on recent input from suppliers, we now expect chip supply shortages in the second quarter ended 30 September 2021 to be greater than in the first quarter, potentially resulting in wholesale volumes about 50% lower than planned, although we are continuing to work to mitigate this,'' it said in an exchange filing. \\n\\n\\tThe ongoing global shortage in semi-conductor chips will lead to a 50% decline in production for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in the September quarter as the automobile maker struggles to make alternative arrangement, it said. \\n\\n\\t''Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) retail sales for the three-month period to 30 June 2021 were significantly up year-on-year, reflecting the continuing recovery in demand from the Covid 19 pandemic, particularly compared to a year ago. However, wholesales in particular were lower than demand would have permitted due to semiconductor supply issues affecting the global auto industry,'' Tata Motors added. \\n\\n\\tJLR's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Thierry Bolloré said that the present semiconductor supply issues represent a significant near-term challenge for the industry which will take time to work through ''but we are encouraged by the strong demand we see for when supply recovers,'' he added. \\n\\n\\tThe company expects the situation to start to improve in the second half of our financial year. However, it said, the broader underlying structural capacity issues will only be resolved as supplier investment in new capacities comes online over the next 12-18 months and so it expects some level of shortages to continue through to the end of the year and beyond.\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\tWith the collapse of talks on Monday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies won’t boost output in August, unless an agreement can be salvaged. That will deprive the global economy of vital extra supplies as demand recovers rapidly from the coronavirus pandemic. \\n\\n\\tWest Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery advanced as much as 2.4% from Friday’s close to $76.98, the highest since November 2014. Crude’s rally will inevitably fan concerns over inflation that are fixating central banks and much of Wall Street. \\n\\n\\t“As negotiations continue, we estimate that most outcomes still imply higher prices in coming months as the physical market tightens,\" Damien Courvalin, head of energy commodity research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a report. \\n\\n\\tDiscussions among the alliance dissolved acrimoniously as the United Arab Emirates blocked a proposal led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. While the situation is fluid and negotiations could be reactivated, the breakdown has damaged the group’s image as a responsible steward of the market. \\nOil and Dollars: Why the UAE Is Risking a Falling-Out With OPEC+ \\n\\n\\tA repeat of last year’s destructive price war, which sent oil crashing, is no longer a “negligible\" prospect, Goldman warns. Traders will be watching for pricing plans from the Saudis and other Middle East exporters, due imminently, to gauge their intentions. \\n\\n\\tOil’s rally has been accompanied by sharp moves in price spreads between monthly contracts, an indication that traders see supply conditions growing tighter. In the Brent market, the premium of November contracts over December jumped by 6.3% to 84 cents a barrel. \\n\\n\\tFront-month Brent was trading for $77.61 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 9:59 a.m. London time. WTI had eased a little from its peak to $76.66. \\n\\n\\tThe 23-nation OPEC+ coalition had been on the brink of an agreement to restore production halted during the pandemic, in monthly increments of 400,000 barrels a day. That plan could still be ratified, or members may choose to informally leak barrels to eager consumers. \\n\\n\\t“I think a compromise will be reached which should allow additional barrels into the market from August,\" said Ole Hansen, head of commodities research at Saxo Bank A/S. “The political pressure from large consumers such as India and China will grow, with Washington probably also adding some pressure.\" \\n\\n\\tThe White House is “closely monitoring the OPEC+ negotiations and their impact on the global economic recovery,\" a spokesperson said on Monday. “Administration officials have been engaged with relevant capitals to urge a compromise solution that will allow proposed production increases to move forward.\" \\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\tThe first batch will be shipped to the Gamaleya Center for quality control. RDIF and Morepen Laboratories signed a cooperation agreement in June 2021 and are actively implementing the technology transfer. \\n\\n\\tSputnik V was granted an emergency use authorization in India on April 12, 2021. India is the leading production hub for Sputnik V. RDIF had reached agreements earlier with other leading pharmaceutical companies in India -- Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech. In total, agreements with partners in India provide for production of more than 850 million doses of Sputnik V per year. \\n\\n\\tTo date, Sputnik V has been registered in 67 countries globally with a total population of over 3.5 billion people. The data obtained by regulators of a number of countries during the vaccination of the population, including Argentina, Serbia, Bahrain, Hungary, Mexico and others, demonstrates that Sputnik V is one of the safest and most effective vaccines against coronavirus. \\n\\n\\tSputnik V is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors and uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots. \\n\\n\\t“As the pandemic is yet far from over and new, more dangerous variants of coronavirus are being detected in various regions of the world, RDIF is increasing capacities for production of Sputnik V in India, one of the key hubs. Agreement with Morepen Laboratories provides for larger amount of Sputnik V to be available both for India and our partners globally to speed up the vaccination with one of the best vaccines in the world,\" Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund said. \\n\\n\\tMorepen’s API facilities at Masulkhana and Baddi are approved by the US FDA and other regulatory bodies of Europe, Asia, and Australia. The company’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Baddi comprises a scientifically integrated complex of 10 plants, each with a specific product profile exporting to over 80 countries worldwide. \\n\\n\\t“The partnership would be our privilege to work jointly on expanding the production base in India. We take this partnership as starting point for long term relationship with RDIF and its partner companies as we look forward for many more areas of common interest. Morepen’s commitment towards this project is step forward towards entry into biosimilars and other biologicals,\" Sushil Suri, chairman & managing director of Morepen Laboratories Limited, said. \\n\\n\\tThe Russian vaccine has already been launched in India under its nationwide covid-19 vaccination program. The efficacy of Sputnik V is 97.6% based on the analysis of data on the coronavirus infection rate among those in Russia vaccinated with both components of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020 to March 31, 2021.',\n",

Paluzzi’s posts says there will be collectible labels on posts, and users will even be able to bid on NFT auctions, share their results in Stories etc. So it’s likely that the companies will partner with popular NFT platforms to facilitate these services. \\n\\n\\tBoth Instagram and Twitter have been working on new features that would allow creators to monetise their posts too, so it’s possible that NFTs are part of those services. “We need to create if we want to be the best platform for creators long term, a whole suite of things, or tools, that creators can use to help do what they do,\" Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram had said earlier this month. \\n\\n\\tTwitter recently introduced a Super Follow feature, a subscription service of sorts, which allows creators to distribute premium content through the platform. Instagram is said to be working on a similar feature, which will allow creators to share premium content through the Stories feature.']"
