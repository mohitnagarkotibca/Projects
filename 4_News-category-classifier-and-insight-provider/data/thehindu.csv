Thousands without power, planes delayed as storm Bella lashes France
"," Tens of thousands were left without electricity and planes were delayed or forced to re-route Sunday as storm Bella caused torrential rain and heavy winds in much of France. Brittany and Normandy in the north and west of France were the first regions to suffer power cuts, but “18,000 households were reconnected” later on Sunday, said power company Enedis.  However, some 34,000 households in the east and centre of France were still without power as the storm made its way across the country.  Over a third of flights from France’s main airport of Charles de Gaulle north of Paris had suffered delays of an average of 50 minutes due to the storm. However, airport operator ADP said “air traffic has now returned to normal”.  Three flights heading to the airport were re-routed to Paris Orly airport south of Paris, while an Aeroflot flight landed in Amsterdam and a plane heading from Luxemburg turned back. A top flight rugby clash between Pau and Stade Francais scheduled for the afternoon was delayed by three hours after the storm prevented the Paris-based team from taking off. The winds and rains abated in some areas by the late afternoon, but heavy snow was forecast on higher ground in the south of the country heading into Monday. Similar troubles were seen in the south of England where winds reaching 170 kilometres (105 miles) an hour were recorded on the Isle of Wight overnight Saturday to Sunday.  Meanwhile some 20,000 households in Wales had their electricity cut while delays were also seen on railways due to trees falling on the line."

SII to launch first indigenous pneumonia vaccine ","The first indigenous vaccine against pneumonia, developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII), will be launched by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday, says information released by the Institute here on Sunday. According to sources, the vaccine will be much more affordable than the existing ones manufactured by two foreign companies.  In July, India’s drug regulator had granted market approval for the Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate vaccine, after reviewing the phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trial data submitted by the Pune-based firm.  “This vaccine is used for active immunisation against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia in infants,” the Health Ministry had said earlier."

Central Africa votes in polls marred by violence
"," Voters went to the polls on Sunday in the Central African Republic in presidential and legislative elections marred by the latest flare-up in a long-running civil war, with many voters unable to cast their ballots. Incumbent Faustin Archange Touadera is the frontrunner in polls that follow a week of turbulence marked by accusations of an attempted coup, rebels briefly seizing the fourth-largest town and Russia and Rwanda dispatching military personnel to help the beleaguered government. UN peacekeepers and local and Rwandan soldiers were patrolling the streets of the capital on Sunday with armoured vehicles posted outside polling stations. Although some stations opened late in Bangui because of a lack of voting materials, senior election officials told AFP they would stay open later to make up for it. “It’s very important for me to be here, as a citizen. I think this vote will change our country, whoever the president will be,” teacher Hortense Reine said. Sixteen candidates are vying for the presidency — Touadera’s main rival is former prime minister Anicet Georges Dologuele. Polling stations began to close at 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) with partial results expected on January 4 and the final totals on January 19. At the end of the day, government spokesman Ange Maxime Kazagui praised “the commitment and determination of the population who defied the armed groups”. And Momokoama Theophile of the National Elections Authority (ANE) told AFP that turnout had been good “despite minor security concerns in some places”.  A runoff will be held on February 14 if there is no overall majority in the first round. Away from Bangui, sporadic fighting has been going on for nine days and scattered incidents were reported early on Sunday. In the northwest, more than 500 kilometres (300 miles) from the capital, rebels seized election materials in Koui and officials received death threats in Ngaoundaye, according to a senior UN official.  In some areas, rebels threatened anyone who went to vote.  The CSSE Strategic Committee for Securing Elections, which is close to the government, listed at least 12 provincial sub-prefectures where voting could not take place.  Meanwhile, thousands of people had not received their voter cards because of the dire security situation, according to local and UN officials who all requested anonymity. “How do we vote when we don’t even have our voter cards,” Robert, from Boali 80 kilometres north of Bangui told AFP by phone -- explosions audible in the background. “Everyone is fleeing at the moment. I’m holed up at home.”  Ahead of the elections many of the 1,500 candidates contesting the 140 seats in the national assembly were unable to campaign. Former president Francois Bozize, who wanted to stand but was barred by judges because he is under UN sanctions, urged people not to vote and backed a rebel coalition. “Stay at home. Let Touadera place his ballot in the box alone,” Bozize said in an audio message published online which his party confirmed to AFP. The government on December 19 accused Bozize of attempting a coup alongside armed groups advancing on the capital, a charge he denies. Fears about the rebels swept the city in the following days, although the UN peacekeeping force MINUSCA said their advance had been stopped. The rebel coalition on Wednesday announced a 72-hour “unilateral ceasefire” in the runup to the vote, only to call it off on Friday saying it would resume its march on the capital.  On Tuesday, the CAR’s fourth-largest town, Bambari, 380 kilometres northeast of Bangui, was overrun but security forces backed by UN peacekeepers regained control the following day. On Sunday, polling stations in Bambari remained closed in the morning because of gunfire from armed groups, according to Jeannot Nguernendji, president of the local peace committee.  The mineral-rich but poverty-stricken CAR has been unstable since independence 60 years ago. Thousands of people have died since a civil war erupted in 2013 and more than a quarter of the population of 4.9 million have fled their homes. Of these, 675,000 are refugees in neighbouring countries and cannot vote. Even though bloodshed has receded in intensity over the last two years, violence remains chronic. Militia groups hold sway over two-thirds of the territory. Experts and opposition figures have already asked what legitimacy the president and 140 MPs to be elected will have, given the obstacles to holding a free vote."

Premier League | Late Wolves equaliser extends Spurs slump
"," Tottenham paid for an overly conservative approach from Jose Mourinho as Romain Saiss’s equaliser four minutes from time earned Wolves a 1-1 draw at Molineux on Sunday. Spurs made a dream start as Tanguy Ndombele opened the scoring in the first minute. But Mourinho’s men have now failed to win in four consecutive league games to heavily dent their hopes of a first league title in 60 years.  Tottenham edge up to fifth, but remain six points adrift of leaders Liverpool. Saiss’s late leveller was no less than Wolves deserved as they dominated the second-half. But it was a familiar story for Spurs as just like in blowing another two points in a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace a fortnight ago, they sat on a precarious 1-0 lead for most of the match and were punished. Tottenham started like a side keen to make amends for last weekend’s lacklustre 2-0 defeat to Leicester. The visitors could even have scored before they did as Son Heung-min’s shot from a narrow angle was blocked behind. From the resulting corner, the ball broke to Ndombele at the edge of the box and his shot deceived Rui Patricio, who should have done better in the Wolves goal. Wolves have struggled for goals since losing Raul Jimenez to a fractured skull last month. The Mexican was at Molineux for the first time since his injury, but his presence was missed on the field as the hosts went onto dominate possession without a cutting edge. Fabio Silva flashed a shot into the side-netting and Daniel Podence fired too close to Hugo Lloris from the edge of box before the break. Nuno Espirito Santo’s men have made a habit of scoring the bulk of their goals in the second-half and looked like the only side capable of scoring after the break. Silva’s claims for a soft penalty were waived away as Tottenham largely restricted the hosts to potshots from range. Ruben Neves curled narrowly over before Wolves’ danger man Pedro Neto saw another effort from the edge of the area deflected just wide. Neto was the provider when Wolves did score the goal their second-half performance deserved. Saiss beat his marker to a corner at the near post and flicked the ball into the far corner. Wolves should even have gone on to win the game when 18-year-old Silva wasted a golden chance for his first Premier League goal from open play with a header straight at Lloris deep in stoppage time."

Land row: Intellectuals protest against treatment meted out to Sen by Visva-Bharati
"," Intellectuals of various fields on Sunday took part in a protest to express their support to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen on the row over his family being in “illegal” possession of land at Visva-Bharati, and denounced the “dictatorial and autocratic” conduct of the central university towards him. Poets Joy Goswami and Subodh Sarkar, singer Kabir Suman, painters Jogen Chowdhury and Suvaprasanna, theatre personality-turned-minister Bratya Basu and others assembled at the compound of the Academy of Fine Arts here to raise their voice on the issue. They were holding placards saying “Will not accept BJP’s insult to Bengalis”, “Insult to Amartya Sen is insult to Bengalis”. Visva-Bharati has recently written to the West Bengal government claiming that dozens of land parcels owned by it were wrongfully recorded in the names of private parties including Sen. The economist said that the entire land occupied by him on the campus was registered on a long term lease that was nowhere close to expiry.  “I protest the dictatorial and autocratic conduct of Visva-Bharati with a personality like Amartya Sen. We are here to register our protest and opposition to the treatment meted out to Sen and express our solidarity with him, Goswami said.  The vice-chancellor of Visva-Bharati was appointed by the BJP-led government at the Centre which is targeting Sen as he had never been afraid to air his views, Suman alleged. Basu said, “The BJP has always been opposed to free thinkers. We have assembled here to voice our protest. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has already pledged her solidarity to Amartya Sen.” Banerjee, also the Trinamool Congress supremo, had claimed that the world renowned economist has been subjected to such attack by the present authorities of the university because of his ideological anti-BJP stance.  The US-based economist, an icon of Bengali achievement on world stage, has often been critical of the Narendra Modi government’’s economic policies. Reacting to the protests, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “Those intellectuals should keep in mind that the Trinamool Congress is fast losing the support of people of the state. They must remember that the TMC uses intellectuals only when it faces imminent defeat.” At an event held on a different issue, senior CPI(M) leader and Left Front chairman Biman Bose said that the way Sen is being treated by Visva-Bharati authorities is most unfortunate.  He said that the West Bengal government should hold discussions with the university authorities so that they stop treating the economist in this way.  Sen was born in 1933 at Santiniketan, which is home to Visva-Bharati, the university founded by Rabindranath Tagore, another Nobel prize recipient and a Bengali icon.  Visva-Bharati authorities had never complained to him or his family about any irregularity in holding the land, the economist said in a statement on the land controversy on Friday. "

JD(U) not in favour of laws against conversion for marriage: KC Tyagi
"," At a time when BJP ruled states are making legislation against conversion for marriage, the Janata Dal (United), an ally of the saffron party in Bihar, on Sunday asserted that such laws will create social hatred and division in the society which it does not approve of.  “An atmosphere of hatred and division is being created in the society in the name of Love Jihad,” Mr. Tyagi told reporters after the party’s national executive meeting here. The term “love jihad” is used by right-wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. “Provisions of the Constitution and CrPC give freedom to two adults to choose life partners of their choice irrespective of one’s religion, caste or region,” Mr. Tyagi said. Socialists have upheld the right of adults to marry irrespective of caste and creed since the days of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, he said. Lohia was a socialist ideologue. The Cabinet in BJP governed Madhya Pradesh on Saturday passed a Bill which provides for prison term of up to 10 years and fine of ₹1 lakh for conversion through marriage or by any other fraudulent means. The bill in some ways is similar to an Ordinance notified by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh last month. In Uttar Pradesh, a PIL has been filed in the Allahabad High Court challenging the ordinance, contending that it impinges upon the fundamental right to choice and right to change of faith. "

Andy Murray receives Australian Open wild-card entry "," Five-time Australian Open finalist Andy Murray has been given a wild-card entry into the first Grand Slam tournament of next year. Former top-ranked Murray has slipped to No. 122 in the ATP rankings after several years of battling hip injuries and surgery. “We welcome Andy back to Melbourne with open arms,” Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said Monday. “As a five-time finalist he has been an integral part of so many amazing matches and storylines in the recent history of the Australian Open.” Murray made a teary retirement announcement in Melbourne two years ago before undergoing a second round of surgeries to extend his career. “His retirement was an emotional moment and seeing him come back, having undergone major surgery and build himself back up to get onto the tour again, will be a highlight of AO 2021,” Tiley added. The rescheduled Australian Open will be played from Feb. 8-21, three weeks later than the original date in order to allow players and officials to spend 14 days in quarantine once they arrive in Australia. The players will be allowed five hours of practice each day at Melbourne Park, but must stay confined to their hotel rooms otherwise. Also receiving a wild card was Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis, who is also recovering from a series of injuries and hasn’t played a tour match since the 2019 U.S. Open. He missed the 2020 Australian Open due to glandular fever. Fellow Australians Destanee Aiava and Arina Rodionova gained wild cards into the 128-women’s draw. India’s Sumit Nagal and China’s Wang Xiyu were awarded wild cards from the Asia-Pacific for the men’s and women’s main draw, respectively."

U.S. government heads toward chaotic end to 2020 as Trump fights Congress
"," The U.S. government headed toward a chaotic last few days of the year as President Donald Trump’s refusal to approve a $2.3 trillion financial package caused millions of jobless Americans to lose benefits and threatened to shut down federal agencies due to lack of funding. Mr. Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20 after losing November’s election, came under pressure on Sunday from lawmakers on both sides to stop blocking the pandemic aid and government funding bill which was approved by Congress last week. The Republican president has demanded that Congress change the bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to $2,000 from $600. Many economists agree that the financial aid in the bill should be higher to get the economy moving again but say that immediate support for Americans hit by coronavirus lockdowns is still urgently needed. Unemployment benefits being paid out to about 14 million people through pandemic programs lapsed on Saturday, but could be restarted until mid-March if Mr. Trump signs the bill. Adding to the uncertainty, the package includes $1.4trillion in spending to fund government agencies. If Trump does not sign the legislation, then a partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday that would put millions of government workers’ incomes at risk, unless Congress steps in with as top-gap measure the president accepts. Republican Senator Pat Toomey told “Fox News Sunday” that Mr. Trump should approve the bill now, then push for more unemployment money later. “I understand the president would like to send bigger checks to everybody. I think what he ought to do is sign this bill and then make the case. Congress can pass another bill,” Toomey said. “You don’t get everything you want, even if you are the president of the United States,” he said. After months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he later said he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892billion in coronavirus financial relief, despite offering no objections to the terms of the deal before Congress voted it through on Monday. Trump spent the Christmas holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. On Sunday morning, he seemed in no rush to try to resolve the stand-off with Congress as he headed for the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. He has also complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid. “What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel,” Senator Bernie Sanders said of the delay. “We are dealing with an unprecedented moment in American history. So many people are hurting,” he told ABC News’ “This Week” show. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, urged Trump to “finally do the right thing for theAmerican people and stop worrying about his ego.”  Americans are living through a bitter holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed nearly 330,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000people, the highest since the pandemic began. The relief package also extends a moratorium on evictions that expires on Dec. 31, refreshes support for small business payrolls, provides funding to help schools re-open and aid for the transport industry and vaccine distribution. Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois,said Trump’s refusal to sign the economic stimulus bill was difficult to fathom. “I don’t get the point,” Kinzinger told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Unless it’s just to create chaos, and show power, and be upset because you lost the election.” The U.S. Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, is preparing to return to work. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives plans to vote on Monday on legislation providing one-time $2,000 checks to people, but Republican lawmakers are already concerned about the cost of the larger package. Without enactment of the broad relief and funding bill, the U.S. government runs out of money at midnight Dec. 28. If the battle with Trump is not resolved by then, Congress must either pass a stopgap funding bill or federal agencies will not have money to fully operate beginning Tuesday. That scenario could be avoided if both the House and Senate pass a funding bill that is separate from the pandemic legislation and the president signs it by midnight Monday."

U.S. taking hard look at variant of coronavirus: Fauci
","  U.S. health officials believe the coronavirus mutation that set off alarms in parts of Britain is no more apt to cause serious illness or be resistant to vaccines than the strain afflicting people in the United States but it still must be taken “very seriously”, the government’s top infectious disease expert said. Dr. Anthony Fauci endorsed the decision of U.S. officials to require negative COVID-19 tests before letting people from Britain enter the U.S.  He declined to weigh in on whether that step should have been taken sooner.  He said the variant strain is something “to follow very carefully” and “we’re looking at it very intensively now”.  “Does it make someone more ill? Is it more serious virus in the sense of virulence? And the answer is, it doesn’t appear to be that way,” Dr. Fauci said.  British officials are telling their US colleagues it appears that the vaccines being rolled out will be strong enough to deal with the new variant but, Dr. Fauci said, “we’re going to be doing the studies ourselves”. Dr. Fauci said the U.S. is at a critical phase of the pandemic, with the worst probably still ahead. He predicted the general population would be getting immunised widely by late March or early April — beyond the frontline workers, older people and certain other segments of the public given priority for the vaccines."

Turkish lawmakers pass bill monitoring civil society groups
"," Turkey’s parliament approved a law Sunday that would increase government monitoring of civil society groups, which rights groups have warned would violate the freedom of association.  Newly introduced articles on associations and foundations, included in the bill on “Preventing Financing of Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,” allow the annual inspection of non-governmental organizations, ostensibly to combat terrorism financing.  The law also lets the interior ministry replace members of associations if they are being investigated on terrorism charges and gives it the power to suspend activities with a court order. It also allows courts to block access to online donation campaigns without permits.  The bill, proposed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, passed with the votes of the party and its nationalist allies.  Turkey’s anti-terrorism laws are broad and have led to the jailing of politicians, journalists, civil society activists and thousands of others.  Nearly 680 civil society groups signed a declaration against the bill, saying it would limit their ability to raise funds and organize while putting them under ministry pressure. They said the law violates the Turkish Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of association.  “Turkish prosecutors regularly open terrorism investigations into people for peacefully exercising rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement before the vote.  The rights group warned the law would “widen the scope for the Interior Ministry to restrict the activities of any organization and individuals engaged in them.” The law would also apply to international civil society groups operating in Turkey.

Top associate of Russia’s Navalny released from detention
","  A top associate of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was released from detention Sunday and said she was charged with trespassing after entering the apartment building of an alleged security operative who inadvertently revealed details of Navalny’s supposed poisoning with a Soviet-era nerve agent.  Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours on Friday after a day of interrogation.  The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into revealing details of his alleged poisoning.  Sobol and her allies denied the accusations and maintained that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of violent trespassing — criminal charges that carry a sentence of up to two years in prison.  Shortly after her release from detention Sunday, Sobol told reporters she has been formally charged and insisted the case against her was “revenge” on Navalny.  On Monday, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he identified as Konstantin Kudryavtsev and described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him with the Soviet-era Novichok agent in August and then tried to cover it up.  Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned.  In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.  Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake. "

Britain says it will sign free trade deal with Turkey this week
","Britain and Turkey are set to sign a free trade deal on Tuesday, the U.K. trade ministry said on Sunday, the first since Prime Minister Boris Johnson secured a new trade agreement with the European Union. The two nations will sign a deal that replicates the existing trading terms between Ankara and London, but British trade minister Liz Truss said that she was hopeful a bespoke deal between the countries could be struck soon. “The deal we expect to sign this week locks in tariff-free trading arrangements and will help support our trading relationship. It will provide certainty for thousands of jobs across the U.K. in the manufacturing, automotive and steel industries,” Ms. Truss said in a statement. “We now look forward to working with Turkey towards an ambitious tailor-made UK-Turkey trade agreement in the near future.” The trading relationship was worth 18.6 billion pounds($25.25 billion) in 2019, and Britain said it was the fifth biggest trade deal the trade ministry had negotiated after agreements with Japan, Canada, Switzerland and Norway. Britain has now signed trade agreements with 62 countries ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period on Jan. 1, when it leaves the EU’s trading arrangements. It clinched its narrow trade deal with the EU, its biggest trading partner, last week."

13 detained during rallies in Belarus, says rights group "," A human rights group said that 13 people were detained in Belarus on Sunday during the traditional weekend protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, who won his sixth term in office in a disputed election.  Local media reported that groups of people took part in small rallies scattered around Minsk, the capital, and in other Belarusian cities. Videos of the protests posted by independent news outlets showed protesters with with red and white flags marching through courtyards in residential areas of Minsk and chanting “Long live Belarus!” and “As long as we're united, we're invincible.” The Viasna human rights center released names of 10 people that have been detained in Minsk and three more in other Belarusian cities.  Mass protests have gripped Belarus, an ex-Soviet nation of 9.5 million people, ever since official results from the Aug. 9 presidential election gave Lukashenko a landslide victory over his widely popular opponent, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. She and her supporters refused to recognize the result, saying the vote was riddled with fraud.  Authorities have cracked down hard on the largely peaceful demonstrations, the biggest of which attracted up to 200,000 people. Police have used stun grenades, tear gas and truncheons to disperse the rallies, and thousands of people have been detained and brutally beaten. Nevertheless, the protests have continued for almost five months.  The opposition's Coordination Council, formed shortly after the election to push for a transition of power, issued a statement on Sunday thanking Belarusians for taking to the streets again during the last weekend of 2020. “The Coordination Council is grateful to brave Belarusians that don't stop despite intimidation and trumped-up accusations in order to draw nearer a life in Belarus that we dream of and deserve,” the statement read. “We know that Belarusians are going into the new year with a common dream and (we) are convinced that we can't be stopped along the way.”"

British tourists sneak out of Swiss ski resort
","  Hundreds of British tourists forced into quarantine in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier fled in the night rather than seeing their holidays go downhill, the local municipality said Sunday. Around 200 of the 420 or so affected British tourists in the luxury Alpine ski station quit under the cover of darkness, the SonntagsZeitung newspaper reported. Switzerland’s ski resorts were set to boom with snow-seeking British tourists — but a flight ban due to the new COVID-19 variant raging in England put those plans on ice. The drastic ruling by the Swiss government also included a 10-day retroactive quarantine for anyone who arrived from Britain since December 14, following the discovery of a new variant of the coronavirus which experts fear spreads more quickly. Some of the British tourists affected in Verbier left immediately, while others stuck it out for a bit before quitting. “Many of them stayed in quarantine for a day before they set off unnoticed under the cover of darkness,” Jean-Marc Sandoz, spokesman for the wider Bagnes municipality, told SZ. He called the whole situation “the worst week our community has ever experienced”. British tourists normally make up 21% of the Verbier clientele, and most start pouring in just after Christmas. Voted Switzerland’s best ski resort for the past two years, Verbier markets itself as offering “adrenaline-packed thrills, simple pleasures and a chic lifestyle”.  The Verbier Tourist Office has been holding daily crisis cell meetings to try to deal with the ever-changing coronavirus picture. “It was when they saw the meal trays remained untouched that the hoteliers noticed that the customers had gone,” Sandoz told ATS news agency. He said that according to a Saturday survey of the ski resort’s hotels, fewer than 10 people would still be in quarantine. The rest would either have left or their quarantine time would have expired. “We can’t blame them. In most cases, quarantine was untenable. Imagine four people staying in a hotel room of 20 square metres,” Sandoz said. He said the tourists left feeling “a little angry with Switzerland” and with the sense of having been “trapped”. Flights between Switzerland and the two countries were halted on Monday, but the first outbound flights from Zurich to Britain resumed on Thursday. Two cases of the new British coronavirus variant have been detected in Switzerland and one in neighbouring Liechtenstein, the Swiss health ministry said Sunday. Two cases of the new South African variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, have also been detected, the ministry said."

Egypt delegation visits Libyan capital, meets Tripoli government
"," Egyptian diplomats and intelligence officials arrived in the Libyan capital of Tripoli on Sunday, Libyan officials said, the most senior Egyptian delegation to visit the western part of the conflict-stricken country in years. The Egyptian delegation was headed by Ayman Badea, the deputy chief of the General Intelligence Service, Egypt’s version of the CIA. The delegation met with Fathi Bashagha, the powerful interior minister of the Tripoli-based government, as well as Emad Trapolsi, head of intelligence in western Libya. Bashagha’s office said in a statement that they discussed “mutual security challenges and ways to enhance security cooperation.” They also discussed ways to support a U.N.-brokered cease-fire deal that Libya’s warring sides reached in October, the statement said. Oil-rich Libya is currently split between the U.N.-supported government in Tripoli and a rival administration based in the city of Benghazi and which controls the country’s east and south. The country was plunged into chaos after the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Egypt views the instability in neighbouring Libya as a national security threat. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates back the eastern forces, led by military commander Khalifa Hifter. The Tripoli government primarily has backing from Turkey, whose military support helped cause the collapse this spring of Hifter’s year-long attempt to capture Tripoli. The Egyptian delegation also met with Ahmed Matiq, the deputy prime minister of the Tripoli government. Matiq said they discussed the reopening of the Egyptian Embassy in Tripoli after an over six-year closure, as well as the resumption of flights between the two countries. There was no official comment from Egypt about the visit, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment.  The visit to western Libya came just over a week after Egypt’s intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, met in Benghazi with Hifter and the speaker of the eastern-based parliament, Aguila Saleh. Bashagha, the Tripoli-based interior minister, seeks to lead an interim government that would rule Libya until an election set for next December. He visited Cairo in November, part of efforts by the two countries to “fight the threat of terrorism and organized crime,” his office said at the time. The Egyptian delegation’s visit also came one day after Turkey’s Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, along with the military’s chief of staff Yasar Guler and other commanders, met with officials in Tripoli. In comments run by Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency on Sunday, Akar threatened to target Hifter’s forces if there were any attacks against Turkish forces in Libya. He called Hifter and his supporters the “main problem” in Libya, an apparent reference to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Akar’s comments seemed to be in response to Hifter, who last week said he would target Turkish troops in Libya if Ankara doesn’t stop interfering in the country. He said Turkey could “leave peacefully or to be driven out by force.” Last week, Turkey’s parliament also extended for 18 months a law that allows the deployment of troops to Libya."
