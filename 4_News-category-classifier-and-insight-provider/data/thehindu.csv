How the Nilgiris is battling COVID-19
","On October 7, 106 people tested positive, taking the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Nilgiris to 4,940. While the easing of restrictions has led to a rising number of cases, the limited healthcare facilities in the mountainous district have so far been able to cope, says District Collector J. Innocent Divya. While raising awareness and dealing with economic difficulties remain pressing challenges, the lockdown has had unintended benefits for the ecology of the Nilgiris. Edited excerpts from an interview with Ananth Krishnan: From the beginning, when COVID-19 started, we began our response early. We are at a very, very fragile location, at a trijunction, with Coimbatore, Karnataka and Kerala bordering us. We had to start early on. Before even the government had put in some restrictions, we ensured that tourist places were closed. So when Kerala was reporting a large number of cases, we had a manageable situation, and for the last few months, we kept it under control. But the recent easing of restrictions has affected us and [also] the fact that cases are increasing in Kerala, Karnataka and Coimbatore. So our numbers also keep increasing. We have no other alternative because our people are entirely dependent on these places for trade or commerce. It is a Catch-22 situation. Our strategy is that we are trying to maintain strict perimeter control of these containment areas; ensuring SOPs are followed without any deviation for which we have special squads; ensuring face-mask wearing; and restricting entry by e-passes, which is helping us keep numbers in check. Of course, this does not apply to local residents, who do travel outside a lot, so cases are increasing. But right now, this containment strategy is working fine, and I am sure we will be able to reduce the numbers in the coming days. Also read | Collector warns of action against illegal tourism in the Nilgiris One is our location at this trijunction, the other is access to medical facilities. As we don’t have so many private players, we are entirely dependent on the government machinery for healthcare. So that is one stress on the administration as well as on the health infrastructure, because the numbers are increasing. We are doing a delicate balancing act between those who require medical care, immediate medical support, and those who require less support in COVID-19 care centres. As far as COVID-19 care centres are concerned, we are very comfortable. We have a large number of facilities. But our medical infrastructure, I would say is, is where we are facing a stress. If the numbers start rising, that is when we will have to press the panic button, but right now we are okay. The Coimbatore infrastructure is helping us. In some cases, the ESI Hospital there is taking our patients who have 70% of their lungs infected, where they require immediate support. The other problem here is with a higher elevation, the oxygen saturation also keeps dipping. So for those patients who have a unstable saturation levels, we prefer to send them to Coimbatore. Raising awareness among the public on mask-wearing has been a big challenge, because people start complaining they are not able to breathe, also because there are lower oxygen levels in the mountains. I think the period of awareness is over and the period of enforcement has begun. I don’t think anybody isn’t aware of the fact that if you don’t wear a mask in public, you are likely to get infected. We have also instituted fines, and it will have to sink into the minds of each and every one of the people so they have to have this feeling that when I go out on the road and I don’t have a mask, I will be fined or I will be severely penalised. The problem with fining is, the moment they see a government vehicle, then they will wear the masks properly. For people who complain about mask wearing, I have offered to arrange a free trip to the COVID-19 ward so they can see how people are fighting for breath. Then they will realise that a mask is nothing. Also read | Violating COVID-19 norms will attract fine in the Nilgiris In the last five months, we have had absolutely no income from the tourism sector. From last month, we have started issuing e-passes for the tourists and opening up public parks like the Botanical Garden. We have been increasing the number of tourists passes, first we started with 50 and now we are processing 200 requests per day. So this way, we are trying to rejuvenate that sector, but also balancing with the medical infrastructure because any tourist who turns positive here will also have to be treated here. For the tea sector, I would say we are very lucky because we restarted early on, when the northeast States were shut down. We just had four days of lockdown. The Chief Minister was kind enough to give us those orders that tea comes under the agriculture sector and as essential services. These few months have been a really watershed moment for the tea industry in the Nilgiris district to such an extent that the small growers have been benefited, so it has been a boon for the tea industry. I think this is nature’s way of giving time because there was so much tourism, and other activities, in the hill district. Yes, we now have a focused strategy and approach towards COVID-19 but there is no lack of attention on the environment sector. For instance, even now, for tree-felling permissions, we are strictly ensuring 50% of the number of trees are replenished by native shola species. The district has a tiger, leopard and elephant population. The numbers are going up. If you go on the Mudumalai road now, it is common to see gaur with their calves, a situation I have never seen in the past three years that I have been here. It is not only a lack of tourism, but intervention to ensure their spaces that has created a positive impact on the population of these endemic species."

India gets second set of Swiss bank account details under automatic info exchange framework "," India has got the second set of Swiss bank account details of its nationals and entities under the automatic exchange of information pact with Switzerland, marking a key milestone in the government’s fight against black money allegedly stashed abroad.  India is among the 86 countries with which Switzerland’s Federal Tax Administration (FTA) has exchanged information on financial accounts within the framework of global standards on AEOI this year.  India had received the first set of details from Switzerland in September 2019 under AEOI (Automatic Exchange of Information), when it involved 75 countries.  The information exchange this year involved nearly 3.1 million (31 lakh) financial accounts, FTA said in a statement on Friday. The number of such accounts was similar in 2019.  While the statement did not explicitly name India among the 86 countries, officials told PTI that India is among the prominent countries with which Switzerland has shared details about financial accounts of clients of Swiss banks and various other financial institutions.  The officials further said a “sizeable number” relates to Indian citizens and entities in the overall exchange of information about over three million financial accounts by Switzerland this year with 86 countries.  Besides, Swiss authorities have already shared information about more than 100 Indian citizens and entities in the past one year on receipt of requests for administrative assistance in cases involving probes into financial wrongdoings including tax evasion, the officials added.  These cases mostly relate to older accounts that might have been closed before 2018, for which Switzerland has shared details with India under an earlier framework of mutual administrative assistance as Indian authorities had provided prima facie evidence of tax-related wrongdoing by those account holders. AEOI is applicable only to accounts that are active or were closed during 2018.  Some of these cases relate to entities set up by Indians in various overseas jurisdictions like Panama, British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands, while the individuals include mostly businessmen and a few politicians and erstwhile royals as well as their family members.  The officials, however, refused to share details about the exact number of accounts or the quantum of assets held in the accounts held by Indians, for which the information has been shared with India, citing strict confidentiality clauses governing the exchange framework.  The information shared by Swiss authorities include identification, account and financial information, such as name, address, country of residence and tax identification number, as well as information concerning the reporting financial institution, account balance and capital income.  The exchanged information will allow tax authorities to verify whether taxpayers have correctly declared their financial accounts in their tax returns. The next exchange would take place in September 2021.  In its statement, FTA said the 86 countries covered under the AEOI this year include 11 new jurisdictions -- Anguilla, Aruba, Bahamas, Bahrain, Grenada, Israel, Kuwait, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Panama and the United Arab Emirates -- in addition to the existing list of 75 countries, with whom information was shared last year.  Further, FTA said the exchange of information this year has been reciprocal with 66 countries. In the case of 20 countries, Switzerland received information but did not provide any, either because those countries do not yet meet the international requirements on confidentiality and data security (9 countries) or because they chose not to receive data (11 countries).  A total of 38 countries will supply their data to Switzerland in accordance with the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (Global Forum) by December 31, 2020. These countries have claimed technical difficulties due to the COVID-19 crisis.  Switzerland’s first such exchange took place at the end of September 2018 and involved 36 countries, but India did not figure in the list at that time.  Currently, around 8,500 reporting financial institutions (banks, trusts, insurers, etc) are registered with FTA. These institutions collected the data and transferred it to FTA. The count has increased from about 7,500 last year.  fta sent information on around 3.1 million financial accounts to the partner states and received information on around 8,15,000 financial accounts from them.  fta also said it cannot provide any information on the amount of financial assets.  switzerland has committed itself to adopting the global standard for the international automatic exchange of information in tax matters. the legal basis for the implementation of aeoi in switzerland came into force on january 1, 2017.  this is the second time that india has received details from swiss authorities under aeoi framework, which provides for the exchange of information on financial accounts, currently active as well as those accounts that were closed during 2018, the year in which the framework agreement became effective.  However, AEOI only relates to accounts that are officially in the name of Indians and they might include those used for business and other genuine purposes.  The Global Forum of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reviews AEOI implementation.  According to experts, the data received by India can be quite useful for establishing a strong prosecution case against those who have any unaccounted wealth, as it provides entire details of deposits and transfers as well as of all earnings, including through investments in securities and other assets.  On condition of anonymity, several officials said the details relate mostly to businessmen, including non-resident Indians now settled in several South-East Asian countries as well as in the US, the UK and even some African and South American countries.  A Swiss delegation was in India in August last year before the first set of details could get shared and the two sides also discussed possible steps to expedite the execution of tax information-sharing requests made by India in specific cases.  It is feared many Indians might have closed their accounts after a global crackdown on black money led to Switzerland buckling under international pressure to open its banking sector for scrutiny to clear the long-held perception of Swiss banks being safe haven for undisclosed funds.  Switzerland agreed to AEOI with India after a long process, including a review of the necessary legal framework in India on data protection and confidentiality. "

Islamabad High Court restrains FIA to arrest journalist over alleged objectionable tweets "," A Pakistani court has restrained the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from arresting a physically-challenged journalist over his alleged objectionable tweets.  The Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued the orders on Thursday on a petition filed by journalist Rana Mohammad Arshad, directing that no adverse action shall be taken against the petitioner, the Dawn newspaper reported. The court adjourned the hearing in the case till October 12, it said.  The IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah also summoned the inquiry officer of the FIA’s Cybercrime Wing on October 12 along with the record against the journalist. A panel of lawyers representing the journalist informed the court that the petitioner was a physically-challenged person and working as a journalist.  They said that Mr. Arshad was being harassed by the FIA’s Cybercrime Wing because of opinions and views expressed by him on social media. According to one of the lawyers of the petitioner, the FIA has served the journalist an undated notice.  The counsel also termed the notice mala fide due to its vague content, the report said. He said that the journalist was summoned by the FIA and later his house was raided by officials of the agency.  However, it was not clear why the authorities wanted to arrest the journalist. Justice Minallah observed: The profession of the petitioner, fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 19-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and the manner in which the respondents (FIA) have so far proceeded in this case, prima facie, raises questions of public importance, particularly abuse of power under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.  The court directed the registrar office to issue notices to the FIA authorities. The officer who has been entrusted (with) inquiry of the case is directed to appear on the next date fixed and explain under what authority of law the undated notice was issued followed by raiding the house of the petitioner as has been alleged, the court order said.  The officer shall also explain why the alleged commission and omission on part of the petitioner were not disclosed in the undated notice, it said.  According to the report, this is the first case in Islamabad in which a legal committee constituted by the Pakistan Bar Council for defence of journalists has filed a petition. "

Rupee settles 8 paise higher at 73.16 against U.S. Dollar "," The rupee strengthened by 8 paise to close at 73.16 (provisional) against the U.S. Dollar on Friday after the Reserve Bank of India decided to keep benchmark interest rate unchanged. Reserve Bank of India on Friday kept repo rate unchanged at 4 % but maintained an accommodative stance, implying more rate cuts in the future if the need arises to support the economy hit by the COVID-19 crisis. At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened at 73.21 against the American currency, then gained ground and finally settled at 73.16 against the U.S. Dollar, up 8 paise from its previous close of 73.24. During the session, the local unit witnessed an intra-day high of 73.02 and a low of 73.26 against the greenback. In light of the RBI monetary policy and also the usual Friday Gsec auction, trading hours were extended for both forex as well as bond markets. “The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept policy rates unchanged and kept the stance as accommodative as was expected. The communication, however, was extremely dovish. The MPC overlooked current elevated inflation prints, viewing them as transient,” said Abhishek Goenka, Founder and CEO, IFA Global. Mr. Goenka further said “the rupee had appreciated and forwards had got received but nationalised banks stepped in at lower levels to support USD-INR“. This is the third consecutive session of gain for the rupee. Meanwhile, the Dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.28 % to 93.34. On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE index ended 326.82 points or 0.81% higher at 40,509.49, while the broader NSE Nifty rose by 79.60 points or 0.67% to 11,914.20.

Commercial vehicles start operating with 100% occupancy in Assam
","Assam on Friday became the first State in the northeast to allow all types of passenger vehicles to operate with 100% occupancy, almost eight months after the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic-induced restrictions kicked in.  This followed a negotiation with the State government to end an indefinite strike the All Assam Motor Transport Association (AAMTA) had called from October 5. “We had on Thursday met the Transport Minister and Departmental officials with our demand to either increase fares if made to carry 50% passengers because of the pandemic, or let us operate with 100% passengers. The government agreed that the lives of thousands of people associated with passenger services were at stake and operating vehicles at old rates with half the passengers was not viable,” AAMTA secretary Pradip Das said. “We received a notification at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, allowing us to carry passengers to the maximum capacity. Some night bus services resumed operation thereafter and all other categories of vehicles from today [Friday] morning,” he added. The AAMTA also conveyed to the government that it was not the duty of vehicle operators to make passengers wear masks.  “We can provide hand sanitisers but it is up to the passenger to take precautions, and the police and Transport authorities can always penalise them for not following safety protocols,” Mr. Das said.

Supreme Court refuses to stay law universities’ counselling on CLAT marks "," The Supreme Court on Friday did not pass any interim order of relief for several aspirants who complained about the conduct of the online Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) of 2020. A three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan refused to stay the counselling and admission process of national law universities based on the CLAT 2020 marks. The court asked those who had approached it to make a representation of their complaints about the conduct of the CLAT before the Grievances Redressal Committee. The petitioners, represented by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, alleged that the CLAT and evaluation was “erroneous, faulty, defective, discriminatory and violative of fundamental rights of the Constitution”. The petition had been filed by several students from across the country led by Uttar Pradesh-based Lavanya Bhatt. They urged the apex court to quash the exam and order it to be re-conducted. The plea further asked the court to direct the consortium to set up a high-powered committee to examine the numerous complaints about “software glitches” and mismatched questions and answers so that students are not put in a dilemma. The petition said a foolproof mechanism should be built to avoid these problems in the future.  The online CLAT 2020 was conducted on September 28. The complaints about the exam included results displaying answers different from the ones ticked; results displaying or calculating marks for questions that were not even attempted by the candidates; 10 wrong questions followed by erroneous answers, etc. The petition also complained about the “unreasonable lengthy design of the CLAT examination”. Over 75000 candidates applied for CLAT, while 68833 downloaded the admit cards. Over 86% took the exam across 300 centres, the petition mentioned."

Sensex rallies 327 pts post RBI policy outcome; extends gains for 7th day "," Equity benchmark index Sensex rallied 327 points on Friday, extending gains for the seventh straight session on the back of financial stocks after the RBI left benchmark rate unchanged but decided to maintain an accommodative stance.  RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das’ comments on expectation of GDP turning positive in the January-March quarter of the current financial year also fuelled the market rally, traders said.  The 30-share BSE index ended 326.82 points or 0.81 % higher at 40,509.49 while the broader NSE Nifty rose by 79.60 points or 0.67 % to 11,914.20.  ICICI Bank was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising around 3 %, followed by Axis Bank, HDFC twins, SBI, L&T, ONGC and Infosys.  On the other hand, Sun Pharma, Asian Paints, Nestle India, UltraTech Cement and HUL declined.  Rate-sensitive banking and financial stocks ended on a positive note, with BSE bankex and finance rising up to 2.64 %, while realty and auto indices closed in the red.  While announcing the MPC decisions, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the benchmark repurchase (repo) rate has been left unchanged at 4 %.  Consequently, the reverse repo rate will also continue to earn 3.35 % for banks for their deposits kept with RBI.  Mr. Das said the Indian economy is entering into a decisive phase in the fight against coronavirus.  He also stated that the contraction in economic growth witnessed in the April-June quarter of the fiscal is “behind us”, adding that the GDP was likely to turn positive at 0.5 % in the January-March quarter of the current financial year.  The policy review outcome was as per expectations, but it was the good commentary on GDP outlook and the liquidity measures announced that cheered the D-Street, said Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO of Samco Group.  The central bank has given forecast of 9.5 % contraction in GDP this fiscal but the silver lining lies in the expectations of GDP growth possibly turning positive by January-March quarter (Q4),” said Gaurav Dua, SVP, Head - Capital Market Strategy & Investments, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.  Overall, the monetary policy is reassuring for the equity investors, he said, adding that it could provide the much required support to the banking stocks that have been lagging in the recent equity market rally.  Meanwhile, bourses in Shanghai ended on a positive note while Hong Kong and Tokyo ended in the red.  Stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading higher in early deals.  International oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.85 % higher at USD 42.97 per barrel. In the forex market, the rupee rose by 8 paise to 73.15 against the U.S. Dollar. "

India has lost one of the greatest Dalit and socialist leaders in Ram Vilas Paswan, says Manmohan Singh
","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday said the country has lost one of the greatest Dalit and socialist leaders in Ram Vilas Paswan. Paswan (74), the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, died at a hospital in Delhi on Thursday, days after he underwent a heart surgery. Also read: Reactions | Ram Vilas Paswan ‘was the voice of the oppressed, and championed the cause of the marginalized’  Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also paid his last tributes to the departed leader and visited the latter’s place.  Gandhi said Paswan raised voice for the most marginalised sections in society and left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and the country.  In a letter to Chirag Paswan, son of the late Union Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh described him as an important Dalit face in the central government.  “In his death our country has lost one of its greatest Dalit and socialist leaders, who always stood for the cause of the poor and downtrodden people of the society,” Dr. Singh said in his condolences.  “Ram Vilas Paswan ji was a very important Dalit face in the central government, of many parties. I have very warm recollections of my association with Shri Paswan ji as a member of the UPA Government which I led in 2004.  “The veteran socialist leader, Paswan ji was also a very efficient administrator who worked very closely with me as Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers, and also served as minister in various ministries,” the former PM said. Dr. Singh said Paswan was a mass leader which is evident from the fact that he won Parliament elections with a record majority from his constituency.  He said Paswan was also a leader who was loved and respected by all with whom he came into contact with, irrespective of their political leniency. Mr. Gandhi, in a letter to Chirag Paswan, said he was deeply saddened by the sudden demise of his father.  “We have lost a veteran leader who left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and our nation.  “In an illustrious public life spanning over five decades, he was the voice of the most marginalised sections of our society and defended the rights of the poor and the vulnerable,” he said in his letter. Mr. Gandhi said as a Member of Parliament and Union Minister, Paswan voiced the interests and concerns of the poor with passion.  “His unwavering commitment to social justice and equality is particularly relevant in these times. His enduring legacy will continue to inspire people dedicated to public service,” the Congress leader added."

Patients who undergo heart surgeries return to normal life, a week after treatment at Chennai hospital
"," Sanjay, 54, V. Ramesh, 44, and M. Narmada, 70, all of whom have recovered from a heart attack, are now leading normal lives. All of them had blocks in multiple arteries requiring bypass surgeries. But they were offered an advanced technique, which reduced their hospital stay to just three to four days. In fact, Mr. Sanjay has returned to work already. All three patients had been admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for just a day, and to the regular ward for another day. On the third day, they were discharged and put on a cardio-rehabilitation programme. This was made possible thanks to the hybrid cath lab facility that Kauvery Hospital has invested in, said R. Anantharaman, senior consultant interventional cardiologist. Mr. Ramesh had a history of heart attack and blocks in the right and left coronary arteries. His heart function was only 30%. Conventionally such patients would have to undergo a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, which requires surgeons to open the chest cavity. The patient would have to undergo two procedures. Not only would this mean longer hospital stay but also the risk of infection during the ongoing pandemic. The surgeon decided to perform a hybrid revascularisation procedure wherein a 3-4 cm incision was made on the left side of the chest and the main bypass grafting for the left coronary artery was done. After checking its functioning through angiography, the surgeon then inserted a stent through angioplasty in the right coronary artery. “Undertaking a complex procedure and enabling the patient to walk back home within a span of two to three days is a huge step in treatment and provides a lot of hope for patients with such conditions. We were able to perform this with the aid of the Hybrid Cath Lab that can facilitate the procedure to be performed in a single stage -- both surgery and stenting at the same time,” he said. The procedure could be offered to patients who would not be able to withstand an open bypass surgery, he added. The hospital’s executive director Aravindan Selvaraj urged people not to postpone treatment for fear of infection. There were enough advancements in medicine that could provide not only relief, but also help them lead normal lives, he said. Mr. Ramesh said his health insurance firm covered the procedure."

It is alleged that all accused are active members of a banned Maoist group. The two chargesheets have no mention of Hindutva leaders Milind Ekbote, executive president of an outfit called “Samastha Hindu Aghadi” and Sambhaji Bhide ‘Guruji’, who heads the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan. Their names were registered on the basis of an eye witness that they had incited violence against the Dalit congregation. The NIA took over the investigation from the Pune police on January 2020. All accused are booked for allegedly delivering inflammatory speeches at the Elgar Parishad conclave at Shaniwar Wada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence at Bhima Koregaon war memorial the next day."

World Food Programme | Five things to know about 2020 Nobel Peace Prize winner
","The UN’s World Food Programme, which won the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, delivers food assistance in emergencies, from wars to civil conflicts, natural disasters and famines. Here are five facts about the Rome-based organisation: Created in 1962 on the request of US President Dwight Eisenhower as an experiment to provide food aid through the UN system, WFP had only existed a few months when an earthquake struck northern Iran. Over 12,000 people died. WFP sent survivors 1,500 metric tons of wheat, 270 tonnes of sugar and 27 tonnes of tea. Others soon needed its help: a typhoon made landfall in Thailand; war refugees needed feeding in Algeria. Full list of Nobel prize 2020 In 1963 WFP’s first school meals project was born. In 1965, the agency became a fully-fledged UN programme. By 2019, it would come to assist 97 million people in 88 countries. WFP says that on any given day it has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes on the move. It distributes over 15 billion rations of food yearly. WFP focuses on emergency assistance as well as rehabilitation and development aid. Two-thirds of its work is in conflict-affected countries, where people are three times more likely to be undernourished than elsewhere. It works closely with the other two Rome-based UN agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which helps countries draw up policy and change legislation to support sustainable agriculture, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which finances projects in poor rural areas. WFP is funded entirely by voluntary donations, most of which comes from governments. It raised $8 billion in 2019, which it says was used to provide 4.2 million metric tons of food and $2.1 billion of cash and vouchers. It has more than 17,000 staff, with 90 percent based in the countries where the agency provides assistance. There are few places where the WFP has not provided assistance. In western Sahel in the 1970s, ravaged by drought, it used “everything in its power — from car to camel, from road to river — to assist those in need”. It delivered 2 million tonnes of food during Ethiopia’s 1984 famine. It was present in Sudan, Rwanda, and in Kosovo, then later in Asia after the 2004 tsunami, and Haiti’s 2010 earthquake. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is suffering the second largest hunger crisis in the world, it assisted 6.9 million people in 2019, as well as helping fight a deadly Ebola virus outbreak. It helps 4.5 million people in war-torn Syria and 300,000 acutely malnourished children in conflict-struck Nigeria. But WFP’s largest emergency response has been in Yemen, where it tries to feed 13 million people each month. Over 821 million people in the world are chronically hungry, while another 135 million are facing severe hunger or starvation, and an additional 130 million could join them by the end of 2020 due to coronavirus, the agency warns. The number of severely food insecure people in the world had already risen nearly 70 percent over the past four years, and the economic fallout from the virus pandemic is expected to spark “a hunger pandemic”, WFP said. “We urgently need more support from donors, who of course are already hard-pressed by the impact of the pandemic in their own countries”. WFP’s logistics services used a network of hubs, passenger and cargo airlinks, and medical evacuation services to enabled a steady flow of cargo and workers to the frontlines of the pandemic. The coronavirus fallout is being felt hardest in Latin America, which has seen an almost three-fold rise in the numbers of people requiring food assistance, as well as West, Central and Southern Africa. “Before the coronavirus even became an issue, I was saying that 2020 would be facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II,” WFP’s executive director David Beasley told the UN security council this year. “With Covid-19, we are not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe”."

Indian Premier League 2020 | Leaders without title play pivotal role in direction that team travels, says Eoin Morgan ","England’s World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan believes that “leaders without title” play an equally important part as the designated one if a team intends to travel in the right direction in its pursuit of greatness.  Morgan is one of the key figures in the Kolkata Knight Riders set-up under Dinesh Karthik’s captaincy and he feels it has worked out well in the first three weeks of Indian Premier League.  So as a distinguished international captain, does he volunteer giving inputs to his skipper or wait for Karthik to approach him as a sounding board?   “I think it has worked really well so far. I think DK and Brendon McCullum lead extremely well within the team,” Morgan told PTI in an exclusive interview.  “Within aspect of the rest of the players, we have a number of senior leaders that take on roles that don’t have a title.   “And within the team, that plays a pivotal part because when other seniors players, apart from captain and coach and vice-captain, lead or take on directions or decisions, it gives absolute clarity for the rest of the team.”   KKR is currently placed fourth on the points table with six points for their three wins.  “Embodying that moving forward is so powerful that it creates intangible things that great teams talk about. Feeling the moment, the sacrifices that you make, it’s all worthwhile. So far we have made it work,” Morgan put forth his view point eloquently.  For an Irishman who has established himself as a respected captain while leading one of the most ethnically diverse cricket teams to global glory, Morgan enjoys that multi-cultural fabric which an IPL dressing room brings with players from different background, different languages, converging to create lasting memories.  “I feel sport is always transient but the language you speak when you are playing that sport tends to stay with you.  “It’s fascinating to watch guys talk about cricket in different languages in the change room and people who don’t know that language tend to understand and get the gist of what they are trying to achieve.”   Like many others, the 34-year-old Morgan also agreed that evolution of franchise cricket has brought players from different walks of life closer in a dressing room environment which promotes friendship.  “...Evolution of franchise cricket has made coming into a change room that has different culture with potentially a different language or two or three different languages a lot more easier to gel.”   He loves the fact that the English cricket fraternity, which looked at IPL as an “after-thought” seven-eight years ago, has come to accept that it now has players who are the most sought-after in this format.  “I think compared to previous seasons, certainly (I) not having played in IPL for a number of seasons, difference between an England player coming in now and an England player coming seven-eight years ago is even more.  “Because now some of our players who play in that England shirt are sought after players. Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer, these guys have genuine chances of becoming MVPs every year.  “That’s the level of confidence that now an English player brings as opposed to before, when it was almost an after-thought because of the conflict within somewhere and English players being deterred to come in many ways.  “It’s a completely different aspect, one that we love coming to town,” ‘Captain’ Morgan said, setting the record straight.  With 2240 runs in 94 T20 Internationals, Morgan has been one of the fine end-game players in shorter formats, a skill that he consciously developed to fit into flexible batting orders.  “I think, over the years, that is something that I have always aspired to do and throughout your career, probably through young age from mid 20s, particularly in international cricket where it is very difficult, standard is always high and there is always a counter to everything that you are trying to do.  “The more you play, the less bad or common mistakes you are going to make. Experience is worth its weight in gold and I have made most of my experience in probably the last two and half to three years,” he said.  Asked about his batting role in KKR line-up, Morgan said that it’s “flexible”, depending on conditions and opposition.  “I think middle-order is quite flexible at the moment, depending on what team we play and type of attack we come up against.   “Different batters are suited to different bowlers and DK and coach are very good at reading what’s the right way to move forward in that regard. We have lot of options which are flexible.” "
